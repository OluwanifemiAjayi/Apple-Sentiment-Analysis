"Cheating with me on iPadI purchased an apple ipad wifi + cellular. Natural expectation is i will be able to make calls using the eSIM. But apple had misleading advertising which led me to purchasing the product.When you say that your product is wifi + cellular. It means cell sim works on it nicely. But not with Apple.

"People buy apple for a Few reasonsPeople buy apple for a few reasons.  Mostly, it's just habit since it's what people are already used to.  Or they need it for work (e.g. devs need a unix system, but don't prefer linux).  And to be fair, it does 'play nice' with beats headphones or macbooks.But that's pretty much it really.  The products themselves aren't any better than what else is on the market.  And the customer service, when anything goes wrong, is a nightmare.  It's why you see those 'genius bars' filled up all the time.Apple software works great, until it doesn't - then it's a nightmare.  And in terms of the hardware, not being able to repair your own device due to their contracts, in addition to being terrible for the environment, is another needless expense.So yeah, buy Apple if you have to.  But it hasn't been a particularly high quality or innovative company for years.Date of experience:June 20, 2024",2,Scott Nelson,1,United States,2024-06-21 15:40:16.479435,fair nice much else wrong nightmare great nightmare able due terrible high innovative,Positive

"Beware, new IPad eSIM onlyI paid nearly £2k for a new iPad with 5g. The thing about new iPads is they don’t come with a sim slot and are designed to use eSim’s. Apple restrict the service providers to only three and they are not the most competitive in the market. I chose one, the eSIM deal worked for a while then stopped (Redteago). I bought another package which did not work at all (Redteago).  I could call Customer Service of the eSIM provider but my life is too short for the agony of ‘sh it’ companies who operate call centres full of people who do not care or worse ‘plastic’ auto attendants routing calls to nowhere.

"Horrible, Arrogant, Smug, Unreachable company leaving people in the lurch at critical timesWhat a horrible arrogant, smug, unreachable company.  Forced me to do an annoying update.  Now iphone stuck on its logo. This must cause enormous life or death damage to some people in critical situations. When you Google for help you basically get a bunch of chatters in chat rooms. Official Apple seems to always be hiding out from its screw ups. They offer worthless guidance to keep presssing buttons that do nothing.   Apple forces you to enter annoying obscure information like serial numbers thrown out on the first day which they know a considerable number of people can't access before even allowing them to chat or call.  I guess non customers have nothing better to do than chat with them.  Is this a scummy way to get people to discard perfectly good phones for unneededly upgraded ones or is the engineerong this awful after billions spent on it?

"Terrible customer serviceI own 3 Iphone devices. One of them is an old work phone (Iphone 11) that I forgot to sign out when I left that job. The challenge starts. I need to reset the phone to give it to my son and as it happens, if you have no access to the old email or phone number linked to the device, you should apparently put the handset in the bin. I managed to have access to the email address with help from ex-colleagues, so managed to start the recovery process to change the password. Once you start, they ask you for an alternative phone number and send you 2 different pass codes. Then they ask for 24 hours to review the case and let you reset the password. Fine. 24 hours after, they ""accept"" to put you in a 13 day security period, and then you are allowed to change the password. WHY? I am reporting that the phone is mine and I have proved having access to an old email, apparently I should have also kept and old work number that I didn't even owned! Iphones are well behind Android phones these days, and on top of that they don't make things easier for the customer.

"Guildford Mall Apple StoreHi and Shalom,Bought the I phone more than a year ago at one point a nice lady contacted me and asked why I had not activated it. Took it twice to the Guildford Mall Surrey, BC Apple store and it did not get activated third time May 13 2024 it worked. Never had this problem with my previous 2 cell phones being activated.This is a copy of the text msg I sent the Genius Bar the same day. ********* being my phone number.Phone appears to be working fine now. Did not like the talk from some of the green shirt employees the Black man with the black mask was telling customers I was a racist and the Filipino man with the light black beard made a number of insulting comments and bragged about fighting. To be sure 90% of the employees were just doing their job and a few went out of their way to be friendly. I am also a shareholder of Apple as are some family and friends it has done well.I did not get a response.For some reason my cell phone voicemail shows 4 msgs on the opening screen but there is only one.Twice in the last year ppl of the Hell's Angels gang have caused me problems within a 5 minute walk of the mall parking lot and if you are interested I can send you the documentation of that.Sincerely,Greg CarrHope, BCDate of experience:May 13, 2024",16,Greg Carr,3,Canada,2024-06-04 00:00:00.000000,nice mall surrey third previous genius green black black racist light black insulting fighting sure last interested send,Positive
"The issues are countlessThe issues are countless, and the popularity is absurd.

They just kept parroting the whole, “child must be transferred to another family until they are 13,” and unwilling to delete said account entirely. It was made on my old device, and I’m fairly positive it’s inactive because I can change the password from my device. However, I cannot access the exs phone number nor update to a new one. I cannot validate the 6 digit pin to complete the process of deleting, transferring to a fake family plan, etc. wasteful af and infuriating.

So you click, like some kind of ignorant rube on the smiling link beckoning you falsely to some promise land of cinematic bliss only...you'll never actually see that film. You might see it sometimes. Other times you'll only hear it. But mostly, like some kind of Nietzesque abyss, you'll only stare at a black polygon that promises a film experience but delivers only excruciating frustration. You'll search high and low for answers like some kind of idiot hoping that the ghost of Steve Jobs will show pity, but his ghost will only spooge on your face and call you the slut for catching his loathing, wrathful seed. You might search for answers in the help bar and it'll say something like, ""go to 'file' and click on 'turn off genius'"" only there are no geniuses here.

"Very distasteful - take the phone and give no money or return the phoneThis is the second time we have been offered an agreed trade in price when buying a new apple phone only to have the offer refreshed to £0 on receipt of the phone. I have had numerous communication regarding this and the operatives have all agreed the phone had no damage - this latest renewed £0 price was due to not erasing the data! The phone was restored to factory settings so how can data remain? When asked why apple would not just clear the data the response was that it was not their property. When I sent the phone in for trade in it became their property and now I am asking for it back - this is proving extremely difficult and after 10 days there is no sign of the old phone! To go from £90 trade in price to £0 with nothing to show for it is criminal and an apple ‘scam’ as there is no way they would not just keep the phone, wipe the data and resell it once I had agreed the £0 trade in value.  After a further 55 minute conversation today the agent told me they were offering a good will gesture to compensate for the time this had taken.Any guesses for what this gesture was? …. It was money off the next purchase from apple, when I contact them to initiate this! Not goodwill at all, further profit making! In the old days this would be stealing as they have my property and I have not been paid for it! £699 for a phone is ridiculous but it was 0% for 2 years and a present for my son!Update - just been sent a message from my bank to say I am now overdrawn as apple have taken £90 from my account!

"A disgusting exploitative companyI am writing this post today to express my absolute disgust for Apple and its brand of overpriced - designed to break- products. I have taken my business elsewhere and plan to never return to apple ever again. It is clear that apple is completely consumed by greed at this point and it does not take a person long to see why. In short, the quality has plummeted while the price has soared. Apple Laptops/iPads have a lifespan of about 2-3 years. Apple does not hide this from you either. This is most apparent in the battery life which they explain lasts 2-3 years (IF WELL MAINTAINED!). The repairs or replacements for these computers are expensive. Think about this reality: you drop 2000$ + tax on a laptop. In 2-3 years you are already going to have to replace the battery which costs anywhere between 400-800$ which is entirely not worth it, so you’re forced into a dilemma: you either pay the 400-800$ for repair for a computer that, in my opinion, is still relatively new (2-3 years is not old) or you drop another 2000$ on another garbage apple computer and allow them to continue sucking your wallet dry until you wake up and realize that their products are garbage and there are WAY BETTER products out there for cheaper. PEOPLE, you are being taken advantage of! If you value your hard earned cash, wake up and realize that apple has designed a system where they have purposefully created cheaper products that break faster so that they can get you to continuously keep buying new apple products. There was a time when apple computers lasted  10 + years, (remember that white plastic laptop from the early 2000’s?) Now they break in 2-3 years. The good old days of quality Apple products is gone and gone with it should be your business and hard earned cash.

"Beware of fraudulent Apple Care support…Beware of fraudulent Apple Care support googled from the web: using IPERIUS app to scam you.   This app is nothing more than a vehicle for scammers, I googled Apple Support this Apple looking web page comes up I think nothing about it dials in, and let the scam begin, a sucker has been born,, well this guy Gabriel, Indian accent begins to tell me the issues I am having with my IPhone is because scammers have compromised my device and a certain protocol using the Iperius App that is being used to broadcast and record the information inside my phone he finesses me out of my Apple ID to underhandedly reroute 500.00 from my account but is claiming that he is attempting to gain the highest amount a scrammer steals at time but my 500 will not come off my account it is a null transaction to cut off any further access to my account.  Then he wanted me to open up me Target Red card and set a null transaction to cut off any further scrammer activity he wanted to go through every card in my Apple wallet, F’ck I felt like a heel after the Apple transaction because that wasn’t a null transaction it went through and he got the merchant id by being able to see through the IPERIUS APP onto my phone by asking my to zoom in open it up you know make the print larger so he could write the numbers down, I figured it out just 20 minutes after the fact, I bleeping call Apple the real number by looking at the web address and making sure it said Apple Care@ Apple.com  and the didn’t even try to reverse the transaction it was still pending so dude gets on the phone tells me he is still in training and crooks move fast and likely there’s is probably nothing he can do, WTH! Dude so I get off the phone with this sacroiliac and call Chase Bank who credits my account for the 500.00 and opens a fraud case, I don’t understand how crooks get the money so fast but anywhere else in the world a regular person experiences a delay while funds go through.

"Apple (Worst Company In The World)I bought an apple watch August 2023, the watch hasn't maintained a charge since I purchased the watch. I called apple support, they told me it is not their responsibility to fix, repair, or replace the apple watch. If they fix, repair, replace the watch, I would have to pay a fee. Even though, I bought the watch less than a year ago! The Owners, CEOs, VPs, and every one in the organization backing these practices should be fired immediately! Nobody spends $700 on an apple product with apple's leadership instructing customer service representatives to tell customers. They are not responsible for their own flawed products being sold to customers worldwide. Why does a company like Apple exist, if they are not responsible for their flawed products? This is by far the worst company I have dealt with in my life! After this, I will never buy an Apple product again! Because, Apple does not back their flawed products!

The device malfunctioned, displaying a baffling ""no battery"" error despite being brand new.

I tried to get reconnected to the technical department but was frustratingly connected to an additional 3 people including managers who were not aware of the issue and refused to help me.I feel Apple is reducing the price of their M2 chip laptops, baiting people into buying their faulty hardware in order to ship as many not fit for purpose units as possible before the flaw was made public!After being unable to resolve over the telephone, as a first step I filed an official complaint against Apple Australia with Consumer Affairs Victoria who told me my purchase is in breach of Australian Consumer Law Section 54 ""acceptable quality"" and Section 55 ""fitness for a disclosed purpose"" (as Consumer Affairs told me).Consumer Affairs recommended I send a formal written letter of complaint to Apple which I had to do by post as Apple have no email support(!).Apple then phoned me and the support staff man was very rude and unfriendly simply telling me Apple had no position on the flaw and it was not an issue!!!Very disappointed and scared to use my new expensive machine.

"My experience with Apple's customer…My experience with Apple's customer service has been nothing short of a nightmare. After purchasing an iPhone 15 Pro Max, my excitement quickly turned to frustration as the device began freezing every other day, particularly when connected to Airpods.Attempting to resolve the issue, I reached out to Apple's customer service, only to be met with a series of ineffective solutions. Despite following their instructions to factory reset the device, the problem persisted. Seeking further assistance, I visited the Apple Store in Watford, where they performed additional resets, yet the issue remained unresolved.After escalating the matter to their engineering team, I was informed that the device would be replaced. However, upon visiting the Apple Store in Reading as instructed, I was shockingly told that a replacement was not possible and that only a repair could be done. Despite reluctantly agreeing to the repair, the device returned to me after a painstaking 3-4 hour wait, still plagued by the same freezing issue.The lack of accountability and empathy from Apple's customer service team throughout this ordeal has been utterly disappointing. It's incomprehensible that a company of such stature struggles to address a single device issue effectively.

"Apple iCloud - Data Access WarningApple has made a choice not to support Users attempt to recover their iCloud data - when locked out due to a common problem.1) A newly created iCloud email is often put into a new iphone by purchasers with help of the techs setting up new iphones as the go to contact email for using  icloud storage.2) Instead - using the purchaser's regular email is much more reliable as the purchaser knows the password and accesses it often.  But encouraged to open an icloud email is often a mistake that costs the user access to their valuable storage data backed up on icloud. They run the risk of losing complete access when the phone fails if they need a simple password reset - years later because they really don't use the icloud email.3) When an iphone fails to power up or is lost, often the iCloud email and password are stored on the no longer reachable phone.4) When replacing the phone (a new device triggers two factor authentication) - iCloud blocks access to all the saved icloud data if the user tries accessing from the new iPhone - if two factor cannot confirm on the missing or broken iphone. An impossible task.5) Not having the icloud password on the missing / broken phone locks many out of their data. Apple disables Google Reviews, so seeing the magnitude of icloud lock outs is hidden.6) Users should be warned to use their own email for icloud storage or they could be locked out.7) Tech support at Apple fails to assist and a Customer Service rep even admitted being locked out for good herself.8) The Apple stores will not use the same Phone, new Purchase with Same ACCOUNT and ID as enough. They will just keep the data locked out and not assist.9) Complaints to the NYS AG resulted in an arrogant dismissive reply of Apple refusing to assist and claiming to keeping data private.10) Apple is too big to be accountable to the NYS AG or its desperate customers.For that reason, Apple is a highly successful tech company - but in conduct - a bad company.People value their photos, contacts and data that they paid for.Date of experience:April 20, 2024",1,Tracy K,1,United States,2024-04-20 00:00:00.000000,due common new new contact regular much reliable open user valuable complete simple password reachable new new impossible many tech good new arrogant dismissive assist big accountable desperate successful bad,Negative

"It’s not just my latest experience with…It’s not just my latest experience with Apple but 90% of my experiences are nightmares. Once upon a time these money goungers used to have truly well-trained knowledgeable c.s. Now they’re all reading the manuscript before they’re able to answer your questions.Bjut even worse than their paathetic deficient customer service, is the profound arrogance and Apple’s abusive policy of believing it still owns your device even after you’ve bought it. By buying their increasing deficient products, you are thethering yourself to them as a servant - a pocket into which they dip and take money and then dictate to you how and when you can use your own device. Oh, the horror. Never ever try to use an email other than their kleptocratic icloud that steals yuor data and photos and then tells you you owe them money for storage while your devices, until a year ago, had as standard practice, up 1 Terabyte. They also have crated a atrashy looking desktop so they’ve disabled and extracted all my data from my previously lovely iMac and tried to persuade to buy one of their new cheapie plastic, ugly destops. A 5 yrs old iMac became “vintage’ and to enable that they stopped using the wonderful Intel chip. So now all their crap is sold with the own “bionic” chip.Now is the time for other electronic manufacturers to start improving their products and behaving ETHICALLY in order to finish off the theft of Apple activities through their devices.  Buy anything but not Apple. Even if it seems deficient now, Apple must be buried with the body of the founder and his partner of this once good and innovative line of products.All you “others” should step up your game because now is the time to chase the thief and fraud out of the market. The thief and fraud is Apple and all its devices and how they then control how and when you can use it, which email you use for your i.d. - no, no, it HAS to be icloud and only they can dictate to you when they will make the i.d. Available to you if you happen to forget your password or type it incorrectly. And to be sure that you do make a typing error, they do not have a function to keep the letters entered visible long enough for you to know.If you can - get rid of your Apple devices. If you’re stuck with them get rid of them soon as it economically feasible. Dump the scumbags. They all deserve to be out of work.

"The Worst Customer Service Experience with AppleMy experience with Apple's customer service has been nothing short of a nightmare. After purchasing an iPhone 15 Pro Max, my excitement quickly turned to frustration as the device began freezing every other day, particularly when connected to Airpods.Attempting to resolve the issue, I reached out to Apple's customer service, only to be met with a series of ineffective solutions. Despite following their instructions to factory reset the device, the problem persisted. Seeking further assistance, I visited the Apple Store in Watford, where they performed additional resets, yet the issue remained unresolved.After escalating the matter to their engineering team, I was informed that the device would be replaced. However, upon visiting the Apple Store in Reading as instructed, I was shockingly told that a replacement was not possible and that only a repair could be done. Despite reluctantly agreeing to the repair, the device returned to me after a painstaking 3-4 hour wait, still plagued by the same freezing issue.The lack of accountability and empathy from Apple's customer service team throughout this ordeal has been utterly disappointing. It's incomprehensible that a company of such stature struggles to address a single device issue effectively. As a result, I've endured three months of frustration, all while juggling the responsibilities of caring for a one-year-old child.I'm at a loss for what more I can do at this point. If anyone has advice on how to navigate this situation or has experienced similar frustrations with Apple's customer service, I would greatly appreciate any guidance.In short, my experience with Apple's customer service has been a profound letdown, and I sincerely hope that they take steps to improve their support processes in the future.Date of experience:May 20, 2024",1,Muhammad Usman,1,United Kingdom,2024-05-20 00:00:00.000000,short pro excitement frustration resolve ineffective reset additional told possible ordeal utterly incomprehensible single navigate similar short,Positive

"Buy Apple and lose your houseI called Apple customer service on the 19th of April and spent quite some time talking to the customer service person..  trying to ascertain what the nameless charges were that were coming out of my account as Apple gives no indication. After taking with her I went into subscriptions and changed my subscription in Adobe Acrobat to monthly in lieu of yearly because our mortgage payment was due to come out the next day and we didn't have the funds to cover both.On the 20th of April, I saw that an amount of $114.99 (yearly subscription) had been taken out of my account despite having changed it to a monthly payment of $7 the day before .I rang apple and spoke to another customer service agent and explained to her that we would be defaulting on our mortgage which was due today and that I needed to have it reversed. She apologised and said there would be a refund but explained it would take 3 days for it to be reviewed and then another 30 days to have it returned... which was no help at all . I asked to speak to management and she put me into a 'manager'.The 'manager' then proceeded to tell me the same thing. Again, i said this was not good enough and that the fact that I was going to default on my mortgage was not my fault but Apple's and I need to have my money refunded immediately to avoid defaulting on my mortgage.- [ ] He then take over the top of me . Accused me of 'cussing ' which I did not and acussed me of 'being a victim' !!!When I asked him his name he refused to answer and then he hung up on me by saying 'goodbye'  although he did not actually hang up on me .. He left me connected but would not talk... he finally hung up on me at 9.15 ishI so regret buying Apple . I moved to themReluctantly because Im a designer and people said they were better.

"iniquitousI recently spent several hours over several phone conversations with Apple Support.  They were totally unable to resolve the first problem (I can't upload photos directly from my photo library, I have to save them to the desktop of my mac before I can attach them to an email or upload to an app).  The first 2 calls invovled the agents sharing my screen and puzzling over this issue which they had never seen before. Then they arranged a call back in a few days:  I was led to believe the agent who called would have researched the issue and be calling with a remedy....but they just said ""how can I help you?"" and hadn't even looked at the notes. One good thing about Apple is that one can get connected to Support pretty quickly.  I guess they can afford that.  But when that support fails - and wastes ones time - its useless.  When I said I wanted to raise a formal complaint I discovered that Apple do not have a complaints policy - I believe in the UK it is a legal requirement to have a complaints policy which refers to the ombudsman service, so I must assume Apple dodge this somehow by their international status.  Must find out!   No policy to send me.  No complaints ref no. (they tried to fob me off with a case ref no. but I said I'd already had quite enough of them). To add insult to injury they sent me an email saying they were glad they were able to help me today and thanks for my feedback.  I eventually got a senior manager, who said all they do is internally review a complaint, and when I said that doesn't help the client, he just said he didn't make the company policy. He could not help in any way whatsoever.  They can and do provide outrageously defective service with total impunity.  Other issues include: a totally defective download from icloud which means EVERYTHING in my phone is awry and I need to spend HOURS and HOURS putting things right (this download was done with a support agent talking me through it and viewing my screen), also my photos do not sync between devices and my icloud calendar events no longer sync.  Alarm calls failed. I do like the visual design of the devices and graphic interfaces (my compliments to the designers), and because of this I invested in 3 devices. As I pointed out, IF any of these issues relate to my not having the very latest IOS upgrade due to the age of my device (2017 Macbook Air), then all of those agents and their senior manager should have said so right from the start of the conversations. If it weren't for the fact that I can't afford to replace all my devices, I would most certainly leave Apple. They are arrogant and disrespectful of clients whilst always pretending to be ""happy to help"".  As for the ""batterygate"" fraud convictions - that just says it all about this iniquitous company.

"Terrible customer support for a compromised product that failed within warranty periodWhilst I am happy with the iPhones and iPads that I have had over the years, Apple have really done themselves no favours with Apple AirTags and related customer support. I have several AirTags. They're over-priced, don't support tracking from Android phones (so my wife cannot check where my AirTags are, not track the one that I gave her for her keyring), don't integrate with Home Assistant, and REALLY stupidly make sounds when you are trying to find them when stolen rather than lost, hence notifying the thief that they are being tracked. However, what is really bad is the support. One of my AirTags went wrong this week. I attempted to reset it following the instructions. I replaced the battery (5 times in total). Came to the conclusion that the AirTag was faulty. Got onto support who agreed (after a live chat that probably lasted well over an hour). They agreed to send me a new one and for me to use the packaging from that to send the old one back. Cheekily they wanted to put a hold payment against a credit card (no company has ever asked to do that before). I agreed. They sent me an email with a link to do the payment details and they ended the live chat. Unfortunately, the system would not accept my details, no matter which card or payment method I chose. Clearly a system fault. I had to start a new live chat to get onto support again. This support person was not only slow, but also useless. Just kept sending me the link repeatedly in the hope that their payment system would suddenly magically work. Of course it didn't. Organised for an escalation, which means being called back at a scheduled time. Called back (a few minutes late) and immediately put on hold before even speaking to a human. The human who eventually took the call couldn't do anything and needed to talk to a more senior person. After two more lots of being on hold the call disconnected. I later received an email saying that the human had tried to call me back (untrue - no missed calls showing). The email said that I could respond to feedback at apple dot com (TrustPilot doesn't let me put the actual address there) which is an unknown alias that doesn't work. The email also gave a website address for feedback, which unfortunately was also wrong. So, havihg spent over an hour trying to breathe life into the failed AirTag, and probably around 3 hours in total interacting with support people, all for a device that costs £35 including taxes, I've given up. Apple support has become truly terrible. AirTags themselves are compromised in terms of usefulness. Yes, I'll keep using iPhones and iPads, but it is unlikely that I will ever purchase anything else from Apple if this is how they now treat long-term customers.Date of experience:April 12, 2024",31,John H,1,United Kingdom,2024-04-13 00:00:00.000000,terrible happy several android bad wrong total live send new old hold sent link live unfortunately card fault new useless late human human senior human untrue actual unknown alias address wrong spent breathe total terrible usefulness unlikely,Negative

"PSA: Once you request AirPods Pro earbud Replacement, you cannot cancel this order (even within 1-2 hours or ordering).My right AirPods Pro earbud had fallen out of my ear while I was ordering lunch at a local store then I tried using my Find My app to try to locate it for a good 30 minutes. When unable to uncover the AirPods on the storefront floor, I assumed it may have fallen into the backpack I was carrying.Upon arrival at home and perusing the backpack, I realized it had gone missing at the store and is probably lost forever (someone may have picked it up) and ordered the replacement part on the app around April 16, 2:47 PM. 15-minutes after that, my Find My app notified me that the AirPods Pro earbud had been found at a location, which happened to be at the store where I noticed the AirPod had gone missing.I walked back to the store, and upon more careful searching, it was found wedged between the seams in a stool. At this point I immediately called Apple Support to try to cancel the replacement, which adds up to $104.07 with the AirPods Pro 2nd gen, Right, Replacement fee being $89.00, shipping charge being $6.95, and Tax at $8.12.I was able to get in touch with a rep within 1 hour who told me after reaching out to the warehouse handling my repair request, I could no longer cancel the order but I can easily return the AirPod within receipt. I asked her if I could get an RMA packing slip from her but she assured me it would be in the package.Fast forward to the next day, I received an email that Apple had shipped the AirPod and then it arrived at my house (no signature service) on 4/18/2024. I opened the package and noted that it had packing sealing tapes but no return address.Due to work related issues, I was busy and was unable to get back in touch with Apple until 4/20/2024. When I reached a representative via text. I learned that what the first representative had told me about easily returning the AirPod was wrong and that I should have refused delivery of the item to receive the refund for the AirPod. At this point, I escalated the case to the rep's manager who expressed empathy for the situation given my experience of rapidly trying to stop the order within 1-2 hours and because I've been told that I could simply return the AirPod replacement upon receipt.This morning I was called by Apple rep who was made privy to the situation and told me that once I had placed the repair request, there was no way of cancelling it as they try to ship the item out as soon as possible. I reminded her of my first interaction with the Apple app and I had called within 1-2 hours of placing the order. Then she read me a line about how because the item was personalized to me, Apple is unable to make use of the AirPod without recycling it. I asked her how is this item personalized for me unless it was somehow customized for my serial #, upon which she responded anyone else could use the AirPod. I also reminded her that I had not used the replacement at all and it remains in the smaller box, sealed upon receipt. To which she responded that the moment the AirPod had been shipped to me, the first two representatives have been incorrect that there was no way to stop the order from occurring and my ability to return the item had been voided. She also emphasized this policy is in place to speed up the fulfillment of the request as AirPods are unusable upon loss of one piece (which is not entirely true). At this point I expressed my disappointment with how this issue was handed given I could not think of any other customer service experience (retail and technical) when I had not been able to reverse a financial commitment within 1-2 hours of making it at which point she noted she'd consider the feed back but recommended that I wait 24 hours upon loss of the apple product prior to requesting a replacement. This advice is annoyingly contrary to her explanation, shipping out the AirPod as soon as possible because they'd be unusable.TLDR, think twice about placing a replacement request for AirPod Pro, because it is permanent and binding even if you were to recover the lost AirPod within 1-2 hours. Also, this customer service experience was probably one of the worse experiences I've had with Apple and I've been a customer since the first iPod in 2001 and owned several MacBook Pros, iPads, and other items in the Apple ecosystem (HomePod, AirTags) and cannot help realize I've enabled this level of customer service over the past several years by being a loyal customer.I typically do avoid making these reviews. But hey, there's a first for everything! Hope some of you can learn from my experience prior to placing a repair request or purchasing an Apple product regardless of whether you think I give off an entitlement vibe for having this personal response.

"Do Not Buy Apple Products - You will Regret !!My purchase with Apple is ending in April 2024. Products are ok, nothing special, it's about customer care and it's arrogant attitude towards customers.Apple store in Reading totally disgusted me, I made an official complaint to Apple.com, but it's complaint handling is just awful as it's store, hence I take the approach go for other brands and end my journey with Apple, and advised my families, friends and anyone I know or I don't to avoid if they can.It started I broke my iPhone, went to store trade in old and get a new one, I was advised my old iPhone worth £80 which is fine to me, so just about proceed with the transaction, the store agent asked me to back up my old iPhone before transaction, I said I already backed up all pictures and contacts etc, however, not sure about old iPhone settings and apps etc, so checked data on iPhone and storage etc, I can see very few things to back up which only takes less than 10 mins max to back up if it is needed, the agent insisted it will takes hours to do so, I said it won't be, then this agent just walked off and refused to help me despite I was there to buy a new phone, what an arrogant attitude, so I ended up go home and backed it up only took 3 mins !!!I had to take next morning off to store again, the prior day agent was day off (I was glad), so a different agent who helped me but said my old iPhone trade in value £25, £55 puffed overnight.I complained this to a supervisor who said prior day £80 trade in value was just an estimate, I said NO, IT WAS NOT because prior day agent who scanned my old phone code and gave that value, this supervisor insisted despite she was not participated in prior day conversation between me and their agent.I was not happy about this supervisor’s response, so I asked about Apple complaint procedure, supervisor said APPLE DOES NOT HAVE COMPLAINT PROCEDURE. I requested to escalate this matter further with store manager, this supervisor said decision will be the same (so supervisor already acted on behalf of store manager), then I changellged her by saying it’s against law not have a complaint procedure in place as a business, she changed this time and said I can escalate to store manager, then I asked for contact info, she said I can email HER (yes, you read correctly, this supervisor asked me to email to her email address !!). Since she offered no solution on this matter, I offered a solution by asking whether she can offer the difference £55 as a credit (this doesn’t included my half day off, fuel drove to store again which is an hour away, parking fee £8, I incurred all these cost because prior day agent attitude), so I can use it again future purchase (it’s in Apple’s favour, so customer spend more money with them), of course NOT, they don’t care and don’t give a Shxx.After this, I thought maybe this’s an isolated case in this particular store, of course it’s proven I was wrong again. I complained online to Apple.com who called me and I explained my experience, the advisor who handled my complained said trade-in value fluctuated which I was never advised, both 1st day agent and 2nd day supervisor failed to mention if this is the case which I do not know, however, it should be customer who bear the cost on Apple agent’s errors, of course, Apple does not care. Agent also said supervisor was right, store manager will have the same decision as the supervisor due to Apple policy which agent cannot explain what policy, I started to wondering Apple Policy is “we make errors will be on customer’s costs”. Then advised me they take my “feedback” which it was an feedback but a complaint.Can you see that how Apple did here – customer made an official complaint, they treat it as “feedback” which is disguising.As an individual, I do not think I can change anything, however, I do believe “I CAN STOP BUYING APPLE PRODUCTS, AND ADVISE OTHERS DO NOT BUY”. Apple do not care and don’t waste your money on it. You are just treated as a number.You may notice, this review profile is not claimed by Apple, hence Apple does not care about any reviews here, I can see lots negative reviews here just consolidated I was not the only one treated badly, many complained “arrogant attitude” here which just proven it’s a brand not worth my money.Date of experience:April 23, 2024",2,Jo,1,United Kingdom,2024-05-04 00:00:00.000000,regret special arrogant official awful end old new old worth fine proceed old sure old back new arrogant next prior different old prior prior old prior happy escalate supervisor half agent future give isolated particular wrong due official individual negative many arrogant proven,Negative

I've been hemorrhaging money to Apple for far too long. Their ecosystem is designed to bleed customers dry at every turn. Want to download an app? Pay up. Want to use basic features? Pay up. It's like living in a dystopian nightmare where every digital convenience comes at an exorbitant price.Enough is enough. I've canceled all payments to Apple and have sworn off their products for good. I'm making the switch to Samsung, where I hope to find a modicum of integrity and respect for their customers. At least with Samsung, I won't constantly feel like I'm being scammed.In conclusion, steer clear of Apple unless you enjoy being fleeced and treated like a disposable cash cow. Save your hard-earned money and invest in a company that values its customers more than its bottom line. Apple, you've lost a customer for life.

"Do not trade in your phone or be convinced to wipe data if you do buy an iPhone. Rely on your yourself and not AppleHere is my detailed experience with Apple recently. Please do not trade in or wipe your phone even if you are being advised to do so. Apple Sales/Customer Service has lost it:I have been a long time Apple customer (iphone, iPad, MacBook Pro). Just bought a new iPhone 15 Pro yesterday (6th April) and here is my frustrating experience with the sales and customer service team at Regent Street store. Firstly, be aware that the new iPhone only comes with a cable - USB-C connector which requires you to buy a separate socket to use in the UK and cannot be used on its own while travelling (on flights, trains, buses etc). This was explained to me by one guy (who apologetically said he is not responsible for making decisions) that Apple was trying to reduce carbon footprint by not wanting to manufacture a bigger box to include the socket. Makes no sense since they are manufacturing a whole new box and charging customers for it. I get it that this is a sales tactic and Apple has made more money and saved with this strategy. Just think that if you are paying an exorbitant price for an iPhone - it would seem fair to have the necessary cables and sockets to easily charge at home without dishing out more.                                                                                 My first question to the sales associate was if my data will get transferred to the new iPhone and this guy kept assuring me it will. He also tells me that I will get £30 for my old phone after checking it and says I can trade in. I was wary of this as I wanted to make sure my data got transferred. I checked to see if any other corporate or company discount applied. And in the new iPhone series it doesn’t.                                        I was guided to the ‘genius bar’ area where data transfer was taking place for a number of people with new devices. And the most common phrase I heard used was that the set-up is complete and the data will continue getting transferred as long as you are on wifi. I stayed for roughly about an hour and half trying to get this sorted and the guy who was coordinating this tells me that the phone is set up and all the data is getting transferred. I asked me over and over again if he is sure that the data will get transferred including mentioning my profession and how important this is. His response – “I have been doing this every day and this is how its done. All your data has been transferred” Note that this is a phone to phone transfer. I felt like they were trying to rush everyone out. I ask him if my phone can be traded in now and he says yes (and I ask again about my data transfer and he is annoyed with me and says that all the data has been transferred), let’s wipe the phone which he then proceeds to do and tells me his colleagues on the floor below will help with the trade in.                                                                                          When I go downstairs – I’m assigned another person who says he will trade it in and runs through a series of checks. After about 10-15 minutes he tells me I can’t trade it in because the touch button doesn’t work so I ask him why didn’t they let me know this before and why did they wipe my phone if that was the case. He tells me they shouldn’t have done that and I can restore it from my new phone if I like. Its almost closing time and I was quite annoyed so I buy one of the £19 socket and leave. This guy selling me the socket tells me that it’s the EU which has made them change to new cable (charging) and that they have reduced the price of iphone because the socket is not included!                                                                        When I go home, after a couple of hours I realise that no data from my ‘Signal’ app is downloaded and because it is an encrypted app – the message I’m getting is to scan from my old iphone to download previous history and numbers.

"Macbook Pro and Apple's Repair PolicyUpon starting my MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, 2 TBT3) laptop, and without any apparent cause, I encountered a completely non-functional display, exhibiting 5 vertical pink bars and one black. If the lid is closed 25 degrees, it functions perfectly. Apple's phone support redirected me to an Apple repair center. Here, I was promptly informed by the technician that the malfunction is hardware-related: worn off communication cables between the computer and the display. This, he acknowledged, is a common issue with these computer models. The repair estimate: €650 — half the Macbook's value: despite the problem being solely caused by communication cables, Apple's solution is to replace the entire display, which, I repeat, works perfectly well when the lid is closed 25 degrees. The official Apple discussion forums have hundreds of users complaining about the same issue, suggesting a recurring hardware issue disregarded by the company. This isn't my first negative experience with Apple; this Mackbook was acquired as a replacement for a 2017 MacBook that suddenly malfunctioned 6 months after warranty expiration with a fatal motherboard failure, and a repair estimate of €700. For a company claiming to be environmentally conscious, the poor quality and short lifespan of hardware, coupled with exorbitant costs for minor repair parts, lead me to believe Apple is simply making use of greenwashing strategies.Date of experience:April 02, 2024",87,Luis Cunha,1,Portugal,2024-04-08 00:00:00.000000,pro pro apparent display vertical black technician common entire official negative warranty fatal conscious poor short exorbitant minor lead,Positive

"A UX Designer’s Perspective on Apple’s…A UX Designer’s Perspective on Apple’s Battery Replacement ServiceI recently encountered a perplexing journey while attempting to replace the battery of my iPhone 12 in the Minneapolis, MN area. This experience has compelled me to examine the service from a user experience standpoint, revealing significant areas for improvement in Apple’s service design.Initial Online Interaction: Misleading ClarityThe process began straightforwardly enough on Apple Support’s website, which offered clear options for battery replacement and associated costs. The “Get an Estimate” tool, along with details on service fees and warranty coverage, seemed user-friendly and set clear expectations. However, the clarity and simplicity of this online interaction soon gave way to confusion and inefficiency.The Booking Process: A Disconnect Between Expectation and RealityThe website’s user journey, from logging into my Apple account to selecting my device and scheduling a repair, was streamlined but misleading. The language used suggested a straightforward appointment for battery replacement at my chosen time and location. However, this expectation was far from the reality I encountered.In-Person Experience: The Crux of the IssueMy scheduled appointment at a local Best Buy, and subsequently at an Apple Store, highlighted a critical flaw in the system. Despite the apparent confirmation of my appointments, neither location had the necessary battery in stock, nor was there a guarantee that a technician would be available. This not only wasted my time but also contradicted the premise of scheduling a specific service appointment.The rationale given for this inconvenience – a carbon-neutral policy limiting stock to prevent waste – is commendable in theory but flawed in practice. It overlooks the environmental cost of customers, like myself, driving multiple times to various locations, only to leave empty-handed.User Experience Insights:* Expectation vs. Reality: There’s a glaring gap between the service expected (as suggested by the website and booking process) and the service actually provided. This misalignment leads to frustration and a diminished trust in the brand.* Communication Breakdown: Effective service UX hinges on transparent communication. Customers should be informed beforehand if the necessary parts or technicians might not be available, allowing them to make informed decisions.* Environmental Considerations vs. Customer Impact: While Apple’s intent to reduce carbon footprint is laudable, the implementation should not adversely affect customer experience. A more balanced approach, perhaps involving better stock management or improved appointment scheduling algorithms, is needed.* Recommendations for Improvement: Apple could enhance its service UX by integrating real-time stock and technician availability into the scheduling process, offering alternative solutions if the initial appointment can’t be honored, and improving its communication strategy regarding its carbon-neutral policy and its impact on services.Conclusion:As a long-time Apple user, my loyalty has been based on not just the quality of products but the accompanying service experience. This encounter has highlighted significant areas where Apple’s service UX falls short, ironically under the banner of sustainability. Enhancing the transparency and reliability of the service process would not only align with Apple’s environmental goals but also reinforce its commitment to customer satisfaction. Apple must bridge the gap between its admirable sustainability ambitions and the practical implications for user experience.Date of experience:April 06, 2024",2,amy fastenau,1,United States,2024-04-08 00:00:00.000000,perspective battery user significant clear clear disconnect misleading appointment local critical apparent necessary available wasted specific commendable environmental multiple various process effective necessary available environmental laudable affect technician alternative initial significant short banner environmental commitment admirable practical,Positive

"Some Apple retail personnel need a personality resetJust the thought of parting with one's venerable iPhone from loss, lagging technology or for any reason can induce heart palpitations. This week, our bank's mobile app and the phone faced an unenforced divorce due to the phone's suddenly outdated technology to accommodate the bank's requirements for what's called ACH deposits.Arriving at a mall Apple store near Albany, NY a half-hour before the official opening, the doors finally opened. We were struck by the number of Apple employees-perhaps 25-compared to the few would-be customers. None of the employees as far as we could tell sported Apple IDs and most were wearing common street clothes. The absence of a professional looking cadre was palpable. They milled about in clusters doing little if anything that could have passed for assigned tasks.We were approached by a young fellow who mumbled something or other when we noted the colors on the basic new generation iPhones, black in particular. The clerk quickly returned with a woman who wore an apple frock of some sort who dressed me down for making a break-the ice comment about the color black. She said there was no room for jokes, 'the world had changed' and any customer drollery was not welcome. She disappeared for some minutes and returned with bad news. The basic and popular SE iPhone was not in stock and commended me to an ATT store. The difference in culture at ATT and Apple was stark. An attentive, well-spoken assist vs. the Apple's relative hostility. Since our old phone was still efficient but lacked a required ACH ability due to our bank's updated requirements, we settled on a pricier iPad. The direct Apple experience left one with a queasy feeling-a regional store-with a quirky culture-to avoid in future.Date of experience:April 02, 2024",1,HL,1,United States,2024-04-05 00:00:00.000000,retail venerable unenforced due mall official common professional palpable little young basic new black particular ice black bad popular se attentive relative old efficient due direct queasy regional,Positive
"NEVER AGAIN 👎🏻After relying solely on Apple products for over a decade due to the perceived safety and security advantages over Android, I recently encountered a concerning change in their system. When my AirPods ran out of battery, I borrowed my husband’s AirPods for a brief gym session. To my shock, I received a notification stating, “AirPods found moving with you. The owner of this item can see its location. Tap to open Find My and see available actions.” Initially, I ignored as I thought is just a warning but after I received same notification over 3/4 times I decide to have a look at what exactly it says, I discovered it was actually instructions on how to disable the AirPods’ location tracking. This essentially can assists a thief in evading detection, even by law enforcement. I wonder what would be if your phone got stolen 😨 !!!! This revelation has shattered my trust in Apple, and I’ve decided it will be my last ever purchase from them.

"APPLECARE - a reviewThis is a generic review for Applecare, the phone-up and screen-sharing tech support free with every Apple product.  I vastly prefer to handle problems by phone conversation with a human, and I find Applecare is by miles the best phone up support of any tech, retail, utility, product, or service.  Very quick to get connected, no AI voice or lengthly menus.  Reps are almost always highly knowledgable, often to the point of geekdom.  They can screen share (without taking over the mouse), a huge help.  Supervisor available if the rep can't handle it.  Best of all, they will teach you how to use aps, suggest tips and workarounds, even help with peripherals, go to websites with you for products or info - just about everything your best bud tech pro would do for you.  I call in more for advice than for actual problems, tho if the support articles were less opaque . . . .  Applecare is why I don't own a PC or android phone.Date of experience:March 23, 2024",42,Scott Semans,5,United States,2024-03-23 00:00:00.000000,generic tech free handle human retail quick ai screen huge available bud tech actual opaque,Positive

I ordered a iPhone 15 Pro Max on the March 16th set to deliver on March 19th. It is the 22nd and it still not delivered. I called them to ask what is happening but the team could only say “my order is processing” and that they have no information. Worse yet, they said the team will reach out to me later. They did not give a timeline for that or anything whatsoever. They did not inform me, call, text, or email leaving me to reach out to them. No communication at all. All they can tell me is that I have to wait. I understand that deliveries can take longer, unforeseen circumstances and all that, but that my order has not been processed? After a week? IN 2024?! That is beyond asinine. Their website still has the delivery date as 19th March. Their delivery process is trash are they do not care about their customers. They are pompous, arrogant, and behave like they are doing you a favor when you are buying their overpriced products.

"Apple Watch gave me burns, and they haven’t helped me at all!Bought an Apple Watch with sports band, never had a skin reaction to anything in my life, but the sports band gave me a painful red burning reaction after a few short days wearing it.Contacted Apple very politely explaining this and asking how to move forward if I could get another strap etc. I was made to wait for calls from senior advisors due to the safety concern, spent over an hour altogether on the phone asking repetitive questions by senior advisor who did not listen (eg. Asking me do I clean it every week when I’d only had it 4 days) to then have to take and send more into them. Got told next day she would call me back (Qiana the senior advisor), she didn’t. I emailed her, she didn’t reply. So I messaged Apple again saying she wasn’t responding to me, then she responded within minutes lying saying she did call me with an attitude to it.Eventually sorted a call with a different senior advisor, to be told the safety engineers don’t think it needs to be escalated any further, but they have advice for me on how to wear it??If it’s painful for me to wear it, I will have to purchase a new strap.This senior advisor, Barbara, had an attitude as well, and told me it’s not apples fault I’ve reacted to something, she doesn’t know how much the watch straps cost but if I need another I’ll have to pay for it.My issue is Apple has billions of pounds, I  don’t have sensitive skin, and their watch band caused my wrist to be burning and painful and itchy for days, I’m heavily pregnant, I have enough pain as it is. And their resolution after days of communication, was I have to pay more? Why they can’t spare £50 out of their billions so I can get the next cheapest watch strap which is a different material and leave their service with a good taste in my mouth and actually use the watch without pain I do not know. The last senior advisor Barbara spoke with me as if I was just trying to get a freebie and was a freeloader, saying it’s not our fault blah blah blah.I’m absolutely gobsmacked. I’ve wasted so much time and energy trying to get this resolved, and it turns out there was no point as they haven’t helped me in the slightest.I get that an Apple Watch is a luxury and I don’t need it, but you would think if a company’s product cause a burn on a pregnant woman’s wrist, they would try to help her and not just ask for more money!Date of experience:March 14, 2024",1,DR,1,United Kingdom,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000000,painful red short senior due repetitive senior listen clean told next senior call call different senior painful wear new senior much sensitive painful itchy pregnant pain spare next different good use last senior much pregnant,Negative

"EMMA Manager poor management skillsSubject: Urgent Feedback Regarding Recent Experience at Apple Store Liverpool OneDear Apple Customer Service Team,I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address a concerning experience I recently had at the Apple Store in Liverpool One. I had booked an appointment for a specific issue and upon arrival, I was met with a disappointing level of customer service that left me utterly shocked.The initial encounter with a staff member regarding my appointment was unwelcoming and lacked the basic customer care skills I would expect from an Apple employee. Subsequently, the manager, Emma, displayed a similar lack of empathy and professionalism, which was disheartening given the reputation of Apple. Her behavior was unacceptable and did not align with the high standards Apple is known for.Despite being asked to return the next day with proof of purchase, my subsequent visit only reinforced the negative experience. Emma's attitude towards me was dismissive and humiliating, making me feel unwelcome and undervalued as a customer.Fortunately, a visit to another Apple Store in London restored my faith in the brand, as the employee I encountered there demonstrated exceptional customer service and quickly resolved the issue. It became evident that the information provided by Emma was incorrect, further highlighting the need for a reevaluation of her role within the company.I urge Apple to address the situation promptly and take necessary steps to ensure that all employees, especially those in management positions, embody the values of excellent customer service and professionalism that Apple is known for. Failure to address this issue may result in continued negative customer experiences at the Liverpool One store.Date of experience:March 11, 2024",6,Blockchain,1,United Kingdom,2024-03-13 00:00:00.000000,poor urgent recent specific arrival disappointing utterly initial basic similar empathy unacceptable align high next proof subsequent negative emma dismissive feel unwelcome exceptional evident incorrect urge necessary excellent address negative,Positive

"The low rating from Apple is not rightIt is unbelievable that Apple has such a bad rating on trust-pilot. 1.9 out of 5!. come on people this can't be true.First of all I did read a lot of them, and unfortunately the complaints are mostly not the HW or SW, but very often the users don't understand the Software, because they never really did there home-work, and got familiar with with it. And yeah it is complex stuff for most of them.Apple (and all the other brands) although try to make it easy, but in the process of doing that a lot of steps are under the surface of the User-Interface (UI). but every time you install a device, all those remarks pop-up and have valuable information, to avoid (user) mistakes in the rest of the install process or usage of the device, …. But who is reading those pop-ups and remarks … ore even the user manual? Or how many users are still doing their own installation most people don’t … Mmmmm.You see it is so easy to blame the company or developer, the support channel, or even the Hardware, (All made in Chine, the same as all the Android-Devices … yes Blackberry, and Nokia OS didn’t survive). I worked 40 years in IT, used Appe-Macintosh in those day’s and all kind of other Hardware and Software, and I can promise all of the people that gave bad reviews, the products that hit the markets nowadays are almost perfect, and not the banana-products (ripens at the customer) I worked with in the early years of Software & Hardware development.Apple has developed one of the best Software interfaces in the market (IOS and macOS) working seamless together in the Apple-eco system. I worked with a lot of operating-systems (DEC-VMS / IBM / UNIX / MacOS / Windows (all the versions) / LINUX / Backberry / Nokia / Android / IOS etc. etc.) and all have there strong point in there window of time. And now it is macOS/IOS time. the easiest Operating system in the world that does a lot for you ... butYOU HAVE TO READ THE MANUALNevertheless there is always room for improvement, and if a Company (like Apple)  is asking top-Dollar for there products the customer can expect top performance at the Support-Department. So Apple polish-up you support-department, improve your products where possible, and if stuff is broken … just replace it. Your profits will hardly suffer.Kind regardsBoudewijnDate of experience:March 12, 2024",1,bob,5,Netherlands,2024-03-12 00:00:00.000000,low unbelievable bad familiar complex easy install valuable usage manual many installation easy blame chine survive bad perfect early strong top possible broken,Positive

"I APPLE did not even bother to send me an email telling me that my laptop was delayed and still in shipment.I purchased a MacBook Air on the 27/2 however I specialised the ram and storage. I was aware that it would take longer to come, (if you don’t specialise it, it’s available for you the next day if ordered online) so I was given a choice of delivery or pick up in store. Delivery was for the 11-12 of May but pick up was on the 11 May, so I chose pick up in store so I could receive the laptop at the earliest time possible. NO WHERE on the delivery option page did it state that the pick up time may change due to delays IT WAS 100% pick up for the 11/3/2024. So I went into store on 11/3/24 only to be told that my laptop was not there, I was then told that specialised products would take extra days to be prepared and I stated that it had been 2 weeks since I ordered it so the extra days had already been waited, they could not say anything to this. I therefore asked when my laptop would arrive they could not tell me this either .APPLE did not even bother to send me an email telling me that my laptop was delayed and still in shipment. So I called customer service only to find out that my laptop would take an extra week to arrive so on the 18/3. I then stated that I had already taken a day of work to pick up this laptop so I’d lost a lot of money and therefore could not take another day of work or uni to come pick it up and they told me that they could not change my delivery option to get it delivered to my address.

"Don't waste your time with apple.  Other competitors sell equally as good products and don't leave their customers feeling cheatedPurchased an iPhone4 and was happy with the handset, until they forced a software upgrade that made the phone unusable.  Ironically, before the software incident, I had planned to buy a newer iPhone in a few months when my phone contract was due for renewal anyway.  However the software update had vexed me to the extent that I didn't trust apple any more and instead moved to another manufacturer's handset which turned out to be fairly good too.  I've since bought several handsets from this other manufacturer in the ten years since this happened... I also know a lot of music producers who are gravitating towards other software and hardware providers for more or less the same reasons.  It seems that apple is inadvertently shrinking its customer base through its software obsoletion policy.  I lost Eur 400 of a handset when apple cheated me with the software update.  But apple lost more; their competitors gained a loyal repeat (possibly lifelong) customer, and furthermore apple most probably lost the custom of some of my friends and family who I was sure to tell.Date of experience:March 08, 2024",87,The Spirit Speaks,2,Ireland,2024-03-08 00:00:00.000000,good happy upgrade unusable incident due update extent good several loyal lifelong custom sure,Positive

"Apple Cineworld Fake Trial Subscription Scam!I have recently purchased a movie ticket from Cineworld (movie chain in UK) and I was offered 1 month free trail of Apple one subscription. But when I opted it thinking free, Apple charged my account £24.99 without any warning or notice. I was in an ipression that I might be getting charged after a month and by that time I could unsubscribe the service. But when I noticed £24.99 was deducted I have cancelled the subscription on the spot and requested for a refund, also explained calling the apple support about the situation.

So my question wasWhay I was not communicated or warned about such scenario?As per UK rule misleading customers or displaying false information is a crime.Apple supprt team asked me for evidence, but I had explained them once I opt for that offer, I don't have the visibility for that promotion (that's how it's set in Cineworld website, as it's an instant offer). I challenged the apple team I could prove them the scenario by booking another moview ticket (as most of the time I use to get this offer after booking the ticket), but set a condition that apple should return the money I spent to book the ticket just to show them the proof. But for that they can't offer such refunds and asked me not to progress in that direction but promised me that they will communicate the apple team of such false promotion is happening and the customers are no warned before charging their account.And the highlight is even after all of these, I got a response from apple saying I'm not eligible for the refund saying a vague reason as ""my purchase does not meet the condition for a refund""! Only apple knows what was the condition they set for the refund.

"When Apple switched Mac's over to their…When Apple switched Mac's over to their own silicon hardware I was absolutely impressed with their performance. I have owned a M1 Macbook Air and a M2 Macbook Air. But even with all the positives of this move. Apple's Mac sales 2023 were down 34%. What's the reason? Well, in my opinion its the operating system MacOS. Its atrociously bad and the move to marry IOS features with MacOS might seem like a no brainer but turns out even the Apple loyalists like myself don't think much of it. Mostly because IOS devices and Mac's are completely different devices. People interact differently with them and the software should represent that. Apple clearly choses form over function in a effort to encircle all their devices into one uniform system. Unfortunately it ignores that Mac's don't have touchscreens so the ability to create such uniform interaction in IOS and MacOS seems incompatible. This is my disappointment in Apple these days where their trying hard to shotgun wedding two operating systems into one. Sonoma is just another example of a broken form of a OS trying to fit into Mac's that have basically not changed since their inception. We are not talking Surface laptops with detachable keyboards, or touchscreens. We are talking traditional laptops and desktops.

"Everything about Apple has gone…Everything about Apple has gone severely downhill, from their customer service to their design. Their customer service reps and management staff are all a bunch of millennial daft heads who complicate everything because they can’t wrap their heads around their jobs- seriously, for the extensive “staff training” I know apple to do, they have gone so far down.As for their design, there’s no creativity, no innovation, and it’s simply elementary. Little glitches here and there are unacceptable for a $1,500 phone. I’ve seen things on a Samsung phone that are far superior to the technology apple is using and I simply do not think apple can fall on their “we are pioneers/giants of the software/technology industry” excuse, what they’ve been delivering lately has been pathetic and after being a loyal apple fan for 15 years, I’ll soon probably be switching to SamsungDate of experience:February 28, 2024",2,Laura Mathias-Joe,2,Canada,2024-02-29 00:00:00.000000,downhill reps extensive design elementary little unacceptable superior pathetic,Positive

"Make your customers happyBought an ipad, apple pen, and apple care for more than $1000 and was told I would get apple tv for free for 3 months. When it didn't show up in my ""Services Included with Purchase"", I messaged to inquire why since I got the Arcade, Fitness, and News+ for free.

They told me I should just create a new apple id but I told them my apple id had never been connected to apple tv before. They told me I had to talk to a supervisor on the phone.Fastforward to talking to a supervisor on the phone: they said that because my mom had (paid) apple tv less than 12 months ago (ended 9 months ago actually), I was unable to get 3 months of free apple tv because we all live in the same household and they couldn't do anything. They said it's because we have family sharing. What?!? They make more than $380 billion and they couldn't spare me 3 months of apple tv? Ridiculous!

He then told me that was 'a reason' - but not 'the reason'. He said Apple never give specific reasons. Not clarifying why does not seem reasonable - but giving me a reason that doesn't apply to me specifically is absolutely no use to me at all, and quoting a reason that cites fraud is rather infuriating.

"From despair to euphoria via Apple ‘Intensive Care’Repair: D6099632207When I began to have problems with my IPad Pro, I thought it simply needed a new battery, and called Apple to learn how/where I might get it repaired.

Time passed… I felt both my arms had been amputated… what was even worse was I now had to cross to the ‘dark side’ and learn to speak ‘Samson Galaxy’ (my son lent me his old one) which, in truth, I found hideous… The hours ticked ever so s l o w l y by, till this morning… when a courier returned my very own, and highly prized, darling IPad Pro… The euphoria I felt was almost over-whelming and I even broke down in tears on the phone with a pal, crying in relief, at the return of my very old and loyal IPad. It was only when I finished the call that I realised just how anxious and insecure I had felt (my excuse is that I live alone in quite a secluded home)in its absence…. So….

"Apple gift card scam may be created by AppleI recently had the unfortunate experience of falling victim to a gift card scam, and I must say that Apple's customer support has been nothing short of a nightmare. From the very beginning, it was evident that Apple's so-called ""support"" system is a sham, designed to frustrate and disappoint its users.Despite explaining my situation in detail and sending in all evidence and photos, the Apple representative showed no interest in helping me recover the funds I lost in the gift card scam. Instead, I was treated with condescension and made to feel as if I were the one at fault. It was as if Apple had no responsibility to protect its users from scams that clearly exploit the vulnerabilities in their platform.It's baffling that a company of Apple's caliber, known for its innovation, cannot devise a more effective and user-friendly system to address fraud and scams.In the end, my problem remains unresolved, and I am left with a bitter taste in my mouth regarding Apple's abysmal customer service. If you value your security and expect a company to stand by you when you face issues, I strongly advise against relying on Apple. They have proven themselves to be indifferent, unhelpful, and ultimately, a company that cares more about profits than the well-being of its users.

"Terrible Customer ServiceI bought a brand new MacBook Pro and couldn't log into using my apple ID. It wouldn't recognize my password. I spoke at length with someone from customer service who tried to help. Ultimately, he had me submit a request to recover my ID and reset my password, as i don't have access to my old MacBook and don't own any other apple products. I received an email confirmation the recovery request, also informing me that on a specified date, and at a specified time, I would receive information that would allow me to reset my password. Date and time came and went and I didn't receive any information from apple. I contacted customer service and spoke to a lady named Jessica who was extremely polite, despite my being upset. She told me that once the request was submitted, I was supposed to power down my MacBook and not use it until I received reset instructions. I wasn't told this by the agent I spoke with. I asked to speak to her supervisor who told me the same thing (despite the fact that this MacBook has NEVER been associated with my apple ID). I use my laptop for business and EVERYTHING is locked up with my apple ID. So, I essentially have a $2000 paperweight, until my ID is recovered. I expressed this frustration to the supervisor who promptly told me that he was there to discuss how much I spent on my MacBook and immediately hung up on me. $2000 may be a small and dismissive amount for him, but that's a lot for me. That, and the fact that my business has essentially come to a stand still because all my information is locked up.Apple, your supervisor is a representative of your company.

I purchased two14 pro iPhones and both phone backs cracked and were under warranty. I was still charged 107.50 for each phone to be fixed. I was also paying for Apple care. These phones were very expensive. The quality of these phones is subpar. I now have to purchase protectors for the front of the phone and the back of the phone and a case. A phone at this price should not break like this. Two  overpriced 14pros a 1200 dollars plus each should not break like a 200 used phone.

"Worst Customer ServiceI wouldn't give even 1 star to this company. My login has been compromised and I lost so much money. I never used Apple Cash and I don't even know how to use it. Some how the money was transferred from my bank account to Apple Cash and used on games. I was told that the  notification was turned off, and I never received any notification about the transfer. Contacted Apple to file a report, customer representative told me, your dispute has been filed. Few days later contacted Apple again, then they told me the dispute has been denied due to the result of all the transaction was approved by me. I don't even have those games on my phone. I am a disable person trying to recover from my car accident. I cannot afford to spend thousands of dollars on games. Many transactions decline and I was never notified. After closing my account someone tried to transfer 16 cents twice and it declined. I contacted police department and reported the fraud. After going through the statement with police officer, we found out almost $8000 was gone. Many transactions took place either in the middle of the night of early morning.  Apple told me that my dispute has been denied twice and they cannot help me anymore. Every single time I contacted, I wrote down the name of the person I spoke with.

"Apple watch allergic reactionBought an Apple watch in November 2023 at the Leeds Apple store. A very friendly advisor ensured I purchased the correct size strap and tried them on me.Started wearing it everyday from Christmas Day and within 2 weeks I had developed a reaction where the fastening metal stud is. This then became sore and inflamed and itchy. Stopped wearing it all the time and the inflammation went down. Put it back on full time apart from charging and it started to react again.Started having to wear a plaster over the back of the metal stud which has solved the issue but I do not remember any marketing that says come and buy an apple watch but make sure you buy a packet of plasters!Contacted apple and after a week they have said I need to loosen the strap which I already had moving from 3 to 4 holes. Clean it better - I already clean the strap. Then the best suggestion from Apple was to get a dermatologist letter to confirm the reaction is to the metal stud. Let me get it right here Apple..... you would like me to go and waste a GP appointment to ask for a referral to a dermatologist which could take years for a letter to confirm the reaction to the metal stud. Is Apple condoning the use of a stretched NHS for customers to prove what they already know and has been documented on the internet numerous times regarding allergic reactions to their studs.The NHS recommends that the first point of contact is a pharmacist which is what I did and they said it was an allergic reaction to the area where the stud is on the strap.Have I asked for a refund of the watch? NOI simply asked if I could be sent some replacement straps that do not have the metal fastening studs on them so as to negate the reaction. This would cost them pennies but no that is not something they do.Come on Apple this is not great customer service, in fact it is not customer service at all.You have a lovely call centre employee who could not have been better for whom the 1 star is for and that alone.Date of experience:February 12, 2024",116,LH,1,United Kingdom,2024-02-12 00:00:00.000000,allergic friendly everyday full wear metal come sure loosen clean clean dermatologist right referral numerous allergic first allergic negate great call,Positive

Rather than admitting they had no idea what was wrong, and that the programmers had no intention of fixing this issue, these people wasted my time trying different things that were never going to fix the problem.  As of today, it turns out Apple is officially retiring iTunes for Windows in favor of a new suite of apps.  Why not just tell me this up front?

"A good upgrade!I have to admit, I get pretty excited whenever a new iPhone comes out, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is no exception. I've been using it as my daily driver for about 2 weeks now and overall I'm pleased, but a few things bug me.Let's start with the good. The 48MP camera takes crazy detailed shots, the always-on display also rules and the battery life has also been solid.But the lack of fingerprint unlock is a real miss after using it on Android phones, not gonna lie. I'm also disappointed in how thick the camera bump is making most cases not fit right. And starting at a thousand bucks? C'mon Apple...you couldn't have kept it under 4 figures like last year?For me personally, it's a great upgrade that does a lot right, but the few drawbacks like no fingerprint scanner and sky-high price means I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars.Date of experience:January 26, 2024",3,Robert Moore,4,United States,2024-02-09 00:00:00.000000,good new pro overall bug good battery fingerprint unlock real disappointed fit right last great upgrade,Positive

It’s like selling a car without wheels… utterly uselessHaving called them they hide behind environmental reasons… in that case 1) use a usb which most people have chargers for or 2) ask your customer during the purchase if they require a charger.Don’t change the charger model causing the requirement for new charger plugs and then say o well we won’t supply them as it’s bad for the environment.

"Apple is devious when it comes to trade insThe Apple products are fine, but the Apple practices and policies suck.  They do not tell you so many details and then screw you when it comes to repairs, trade ins, purchases.  Then when you call to discuss, the customer service reps are arrogant and absolutely uncaring.  They only care about screwing the customer out of money that was promised - they tell you what your trade in is estimated to be, but then do not give you that because maybe you used a gift card for the purchase or 'market changed'.  Always an excuse or technicality that is 'written in the agreement' somewhere.Certainly makes me now want to look at Samsung.Date of experience:February 02, 2024",1,Michael Faddis,1,United States,2024-02-02 00:00:00.000000,devious fine many uncaring technicality,Positive

"Older Mac Mini, moving data from iCloudI have an older Mac Mini. I made the mistake of purchasing a large amount of iCloud storage thinking I was making a 'copy' in the cloud of everything on my computer. I even bought a large capacity external drive because these things were THAT important to me. Photos, iPhoto, pictures, documents, etc... No. It's NOT a copy. They basically OWN your data and have you by the throat to pay to access it forever for a price or lose it. Be aware that if you sync your computer to iCloud, if you cancel cloud at any point, it will wipe your computer clean. You have 30 days to retrieve anything from the cloud.So being it was more important for me to have everything on my computer and external drive where 'I' could access and control it, I wanted to cancel cloud. Seemed nobody knew how to do it and only wanted to give me 15 minutes, the 'rule' now. I managed to speak with several 'senior advisors', only one who was polite, but each telling me a different thing. Now I'm afraid to delete anything in the trash because the last advisor I spoke with was a real ssass.I am now almost out of space on my computer unless I hit delete and empty the trash. Same with my external drive. I was only using a sliver before.You would think that moving data from the cloud would be something every customer service tech would know how to do. Even senior advisors were telling me that pictures in my picture folder (not just the colorful photo app) were not being stored in the cloud, and I showed them they WERE. Now I'm shaking wondering if it's safe to empty my trash. I have no idea how to save pictures, photos, documents to a new external drive, and I was, basically, told that they were done with me and my outdated computer. Too old to get things out of the cloud. Beeshoot. I asked this last senior advisor if I were to buy a brand new Mac, naively threw things in the cloud, would he be willing to take whatever time was needed to help me get it out. Yes.I was prompted at the beginning of my calls if I wanted to complete a survey. These last couple of times, no survey sent. I even asked this last one for a survey and was hung up on. So now I'm going to have to buy a new external drive and lots of DVDs because I'm afraid I'll lose memories. They really don't care how many memories you lose. Many times problems were even blamed on my computer and how old it was, and it was something they did to screw things up, like updating to an incompatible operating system to where I needed a senior advisor to take it back.If they don't care to take the time to make sure I don't lose memories, just because I haven't yet forked out money for a new one...and I don't care how many hours it takes...then they don't deserve me or you.I have a cat with kidney disease who's waiting to snuggle, pictures of him I cannot lose, a father I lost, pets I've lost, weddings, etc... I want an advisor that doesn't tell me something different to where I accidently delete memories that I can never get back.Find one Apple. Only one 'senior advisor' wasn't in a hurry, treating me like a pain in the sass, or even talking to me like I should get lost, sighing and hanging up on me (the last one). The only way you'll ever get $1200 from me is if you make sure I lose nothing, and since different senior advisors are telling me different things, they wonder why I'm scared and couldn't care less.Date of experience:January 28, 2024",1,CEA,1,United States,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000000,large large external important lose aware cloud clean important external cancel give speak several polite different afraid trash last real hit delete empty trash external senior colorful safe empty new external old last senior new willing complete last last new external many many old incompatible senior sure lose new many cat different last make sure different senior different,Positive

If you’re asking me to talk about functionalities, Apple gadgets are absolutely NOT the answer.There’s a saying that where there’s a price, there’s value, but frankly I don’t think that applies for Apple’s products. Unnecessarily complicated, overpriced, typical, and uninspired. I personally don’t think there’s anything innovative or game-changing about Apple’s products.

"Shameful customer serviceI recently purchased an iPhone 15 Plus from Apple, only to discover a significant issue with its camera - all photos were blurry and dark, a stark contrast to the same model my partner owns. Relying on my phone for work, I contacted Apple Support and was advised to visit the nearest Apple Store in Bristol, a 50-mile journey, with the assurance of a quick replacement.However, my experience at the Bristol Apple Store was deeply disappointing. Despite the phone’s clear manufacturing defect, the staff refused to provide a replacement. They insisted the only option was to leave the phone for repair and return later, disregarding the inconvenience and work loss this would cause me.I argued that, having paid over £800, I expected a new, fully functional device, not a repaired one that would essentially become refurbished. This defect was present upon receipt, not due to any damage over time. Yet, both the store assistant and the manager remained inflexible, ignoring my concerns about additional travel costs, time, and work loss.This encounter reflects poorly on Apple’s customer service, especially considering the high cost of their products. Many companies would apologize and replace a defective item they sold, but it seems not Apple. This experience has left me feeling undervalued as a customer and raises serious questions about their after-sales support.We have been loyal customers for over 15 years, always recommending apple products to friends and acquaintances, but after this experience we are going to shift toward other companies.Date of experience:January 28, 2024",3,T cata,1,United Kingdom,2024-01-28 00:00:00.000000,shameful significant dark quick disappointing clear defect inconvenience new functional defect present due assistant inflexible additional high many defective serious,Negative

"Apple in AsiaI sponsor a young man in the Philippines to go to school and have done so for the past 3yrs. He’s done extremely well and I decided to buy him a new iPhone for Christmas. He received the phone and was over joyed to have it. Within 5 days of receiving the phone he discovered that it was one of those iPhone 15pros that overheat, battery drains fast and the phone shuts down because of the overheating. I instructed him to call customer service and request a replacement; that was 15days ago. It was agreed that Harvey would be able to use the phone until the replacement arrived. The replacement was shipped and sits in Manila for the past 5 days. Now they’re saying that Harvey can’t get the replacement until they receive the defective phone. Problem is that we have no idea where to ship it. Apple won’t give us a shipping address. We have a return number but can’t get a shipping address to return the phone.

"Short storyShort story. I bought Apple Airpods Pro 1st generation. After 3/4 of a year in right earbud I got crackling sound sometimes whistle in ear. After research I thought cleaning them off would help, although they where not much dirty. While I was working I found time one week after one year of buying them to go to Apple ""covent garden"" to ask what to do, if there is a replacement or similar because this looks like it's an issue of manufacturer.They did quick test and came back to me with a result telling me that actually both earbuds failed their test. They stated that this is an apple malfunction. So I asked if there is a replacement for this.Unfortunately, they sad, they can't do anything, because my guaranty expired one week ago. They told me what a shame. I asked, you sold me faulty product, and you can't do anything? They offered me a replacement for almost 160 pounds or to talk to Amazon, because they sold me their faulty product.I of-course asked Amazon. Amazon offered me free repair. So I send my Apple Airpods Pro back to Amazon. After almost 3 weeks, Amazon told me the repair would cost more than a new one. They offered me full refund. I took the full refund.In this moment I realised, Amazon is really amazing. Not only Amazon fully refunded me, Amazon covered for Apple failure. Apple, who actually don't care about their customers when it is their fault.However, I never bought a new pair of any Apple headphones since than.

"NO DELIVERY OF PHONE AND OTHER ITEMS / INCOMPLETE REFUNDNO DELIVERY OF PHONE AND OTHER ITEMS AND NO COMPLETE REFUND - I wish I could give a no star review. I ordered an iPhone 15 Pro max (1TB), Airpods, a USB-C power adapter and phone case on 9th January, 2024. I was informed it was next day delivery but it wasn't, delivery was arranged for the following day - so the next 2 days. I had no problem with this. DHL was to deliver my items but they didn't. They lied that they called me when they arrived at the address - which they didn't, and then left as I was unavailable. They sent me a text message stating this when delivery was attempted. They NEVER called. There was no way to track them on the app as well as no maps are available until after the attempted delivery. Delivery was to my office address as I knew I would be there at the time of delivery, and Yes, I was available, it's just that the reception was closed as they came after office hours, when expected delivery was actually meant to be within 3pm and 4pm/5pm. I called DHL and Apple to make a complaint. Stating that no one called me and that I had to run from where I was working to the reception to see if I could get to the delivery driver but they had already left. I rescheduled delivery for Monday (2 working days later) and asked that I BE CALLED when they arrived cause the reception might be closed but I would be in the premises.I asked if I could change the address to direct the driver to exactly where I would be at but I was told I couldn't do this. Although I was assured by Apple and DHL that I would be called by the driver on the next attempt. Come Monday, I get a message that my delivery would be rescheduled as there was a road traffic accident. I called again to complain about this and still reminded that I should be called on the next delivery attempt. I also asked Apple to let them know to deliver during office hours as I felt the same thing that happened on the first delivery attempt would happen again, as I felt the delivery driver would assume as the reception is closed, there would definitely be no one available to receive the items. I was assured I would be called and delivery would be made within office hours. Next attempt was the following day Tuesday- expected delivery within 6:59pm to 7:59pm. WHAT???. I'm on edge, waiting for delivery. Ask me why I get a message at 7:59pm stating a delivery attempt was made and I was called but not available - LIES AGAIN, I wasn't called. At this point I run like crazy to the reception and no one was there. I called Apple immediately as DHL customer care closes at 7pm. I asked for a refund. I'm told I had to wait about 2 weeks to get a FULL refund. I paid £1896 but Apple decided to pay me just £297 today (23rd January 2024). I was NOT refunded for the phone (£1599) just the other bits I ordered. I've called Apple now and they say there was an error with the courier service or something and the iPhone was not returned to the warehouse or something of the sort. I have to wait an extra 24 to 48 hours to get an email regarding my refund. ALL this just to get a phone. I've been an Apple user from 2008 and never would've thought they could be so incompetent. Why use a third party delivery service that are rubbish, in this case. I make complaints about how bad customer service had been with relation to my phone delivery and I don't think they even cared about what I was going through mentally (the stress of it all -calling them and chasing delivery) and physically (running long distances like crazy to catch up with a delivery truck/van.

"I feel compelled to write this review…I feel compelled to write this review after a horrible depressing experience with one of the other multi trillion dollar companies and wrote a negative review.Apple are a massive if not the most massive company and I have used them for over a decade.During this period I have NEVER felt that I am being treated like an irrelevant customer.  I have never felt that my data is being misused.  I have never had a single issue with the customer services systems.If I want a refund - I request it and I get it.It’s simple to cancel subscriptions. It’s simple to dispute and find resolution at all times.In short, and I may sound like a fan boy - credit where it’s due, Apple behave impeccably.Yes their products are massively expensive, but if this is paid back with a respectful customer experience, I’m happy to pay for it.It’s all about trust.Trust is EARNED - and Apple have earned mine.Date of experience:January 23, 2024",3,Martin Smith,5,United Kingdom,2024-01-23 00:00:00.000000,write horrible negative massive massive irrelevant single simple simple short due expensive respectful happy,Negative

"Extremely Disappointing Customer Service ExperienceSubject:I recently had the most frustrating experience with Apple's business customer service that I feel compelled to share. The representative I spoke with displayed a complete lack of understanding and an astonishing level of impatience and condescension.Upon attempting to explain my issue, the representative interrupted me incessantly and seemed disinterested in hearing the details. Instead of allowing me to articulate the problem fully, he abruptly asserted that it was too complicated for me to comprehend or resolve on my own. This patronizing attitude was both unwarranted and offensive. To add insult to injury, the representative spent a staggering 30 minutes providing me with irrelevant and useless information completely unrelated to my concern. It was abundantly clear that he had no intention of addressing my issue or providing any meaningful assistance. The call ended abruptly and unprofessionally, leaving me with a sense of utter disappointment. I am deeply dissatisfied with the quality of customer service I received, and I expected much more from a company of Apple's stature. This experience has lowered ever further my perception of Apple's customer service and left me questioning the company's commitment to resolving customer issues respectfully and effectively. I sincerely hope that Apple takes the necessary steps to improve the training and professionalism of its customer service representatives to prevent other customers from enduring similarly distressing encounters.Date of experience:January 23, 2024",1,Support Cannabotech,1,United Kingdom,2024-01-23 00:00:00.000000,disappointing representative displayed complete level articulate unwarranted offensive insult representative irrelevant useless unrelated clear meaningful utter dissatisfied much necessary,Negative

"How to contact the Secret Apple Service DepartmentI’ve been an Apple consumer for almost 20 years. I’ve owned everything from an iPod Mini to several generations of AirPods to a Mac Book Pro to almost every new phone. They did me dirty in 2023. I spent a lot of money at one time on gaming. They started blocking my purchases. When I called, I explained why the uptick in gaming expenses. They did not believe me and shut down my Apple account that I’d had for almost 20 years citing fraud. No way to get it back except for 30 calls later and someone gave me the below address to write to. It’s supposedly “elite” and you can’t even call these people. Yeah, sure. The rep was nice though and I couldn’t tell if she was lying. I’m sharing it here because I have zero loyalty to Apple anymore. I hope some of you find it helpful if you’re in my situation. I didn’t write in because I’m fed up with Apple and their arbitrary and unreasonable rules. It took me MONTHS before someone would tell me what I could do to get my account back (ie. write a letter to the below address). And by then, I just didn’t care. I could prove every single thing I’d done but they shut down my account anyway. Shame on them.I just pre-ordered the Samsung Galaxy S24, the newest in AI tech. Pretty sure I’ll be happier over there.

"Think twice before purchasing an Apple productAfter 15 years of enduring the high-priced rollercoaster that is Apple, I feel compelled to share my nightmarish experience to forewarn potential customers about the abyss they might be stepping into.Every Macbook Pro I've owned has been a breeding ground for monumental issues, transforming my once-loyal relationship with Apple into a saga of frustration, financial drain, and wasted time. While I spare you the exhaustive list of problems spanning over a decade, my recent encounter with the 16"" M2 Macbook Pro, draining 4500 euros from my pockets, is the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.Barely weeks after unwrapping the overpriced beast, it descended into chaos, plagued by a series of maladies culminating in faulty memory modules. A whopping 10 months of enduring this technological horror show, and here I am, on day 4 without my device. Apple, with its trademark indifference, expects me to patiently wait until sometime late next week for its return. Each passing day is not just a lost day but a direct hit on my earnings.This marks the bitter end of my dalliance with Apple. The astronomical price tags they attach to their products no longer masquerade the glaring performance issues and the abysmal lack of responsibility exhibited by their customer service. While their support team can muster a friendly facade, it crumbles when it comes to compensating users for their troubles, expediting repairs, or admitting any wrongdoing. According to the latest Apple messenger, once the initial 14-day grace period (thanks to EU law) expires, it's open season on the hapless customer.I refuse to be the financial lifeline for a company that shamelessly shirks accountability for the subpar quality of its products. It's crystal clear to me that Apple's devices are designed to decay with each passing generation, forcing users into a perpetual cycle of repairs, upgrades, and wasted money.

When they were finally taken out of the sealed box at Christmas, we found out that they will charge but are NOT discoverable in Bluetooth. I did a search and found dozens of other consumers had the same problem with those models (some said theirs stopped working within 6 months to a year). I called 🍏 and was told the item is extinct (came out late 2016...years before I got them) and therefore cannot be repaired or replaced. You would think since 🍎 bought that company they would have a better, reliable product even if it was free or is that why it was free? So the next time you are offered a ""free"" with purchase item from them, open the box right away to see if you too received a dud.Date of experience:December 24, 2023",3,R P,1,Canada,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000000,free right fit discoverable extinct late reliable free free next free open received,Positive

I got a credit of £15 back to my credit card, and £285 to my Apple account which I will have no use of! When I called the Customer Service, I was told I was credited £285 in my Apple account because I have paid with a £285 balance for the new iPhone. Well, I paid £714 on top of this balance! Why am I receiving the lowest amount as a balance instead of a cashback to my credit card? This makes no sense. I have no use of this money that stays in my Apple account because I'm not an Apple enthusiast and I change my iPhone every 3 years and my Macbook every 5 years only. Terrible system and terrible Customer Service. I will never ever shop from Apple again.

"Stay Clear of Mac ProductsI have purchased so many Apple products over the last 17 years ranging from phones, watches, iPads, AirPods & finally a MacBook Air.This brings me onto the subject matter, that’s it never again, purchased a MacBook Air in Jan 2016 - at the time a high spec model including i7 processor & 256 SSD £1300-1400 if I remember rightly. A hardly used machine as most of my computing needs done at work or on my IPad Pro, it is to say the least immaculate!Turned it on a few days ago to check for any updates & a smell came from the machine, clearly something burnt out on the boards inside as it no longer starts up.Called Apple support - absolutely no sympathy!! I understand things can’t last forever, but I was lead to believe that Macs were good for 10 years plus & worth their value over a cheap £300/400 from the likes of PC World/Currys.Absolute truth, I will never ever buy a Mac product again for myself, members of my family nor would I recommend them. Your better spending less money on a windows based machine and renewing it every 3/4 years.I’m totally disillusioned with Apple they have had so much money from me over the years & not prepared to assist in any way.Stay clear of Apple products especially Macs of any kind, far too expensive & longevity clearly not as I was lead to believe by the sales pitch/teams.Date of experience:January 05, 2024",83,J Neale,1,United Kingdom,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000000,clear many last subject high used immaculate burnt sympathy last lead good worth cheap mac much assist clear expensive lead,Positive

"Apple won't let you pause a…Apple won't let you pause a subscription!Apple is currently worth upwards of $3 TRILLION and they can't spare a few dollars to allow a subscriber to pause their Apple One subscription for a month, so I can take my sick dog to the vet!Obviously, I've fallen on hard times. BUT, I've been backing up my data to iCloud for nearly 15 YEARS, and I NEVER missed a month's subscription fee.Apple continues to raise their Apple One subscription cost every year, and they could care less about customer loyalty.I ask for a ONE MONTH pause, but my only options are downgrading or cancelling, and losing 15 YEARS of data (unless I find a way to back everything up... and BTW, instructions to do this aren't readily available on the Apple Support site, because they don't want anyone to cancel their subscription! God forbid they should lose $26.00/month!).Used to be that I paid $9.99/month for 2 TB of data, but now they have it structured so that I have to keep one of their other services (Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc...) ON TOP OF my iCloud data, but since they bundled everything into the Apple One, I don't have the option to downgrade to data only.While I don't want to lose my Apple Music either, I have to pay a MINIMUM of $16.99 this month.Greed is driving this world, and everyone is complacent. It's been normalized, while those of us down on the bottom of the food chain, are struggling to make ends meet, while these guys care more about their gains or losses from the last quarter...  OMG! They lost a fraction of a point last quarter. Let's raise all of our Apple One subscriber's fees by $2.00. They can afford $26.00 a month, and if they can't, oh well. Too bad.If you're a TRILLION dollar company, YOU CAN AFFORD to let your customer go a month or two without paying the fee, and if the subscriber wants to reinstate their account a month or two later, THEY CAN PAY THE FEES later!For example, if I paused my account for a month, when I reinstate my account next month, I pay an extra $9.99, because they kept my data in my iCloud. I'm not saying they should keep my data indefinitely, but they should care way more about their loyal customers than their bottom line!Thanks for reading my review. I'm not some pathetic, broke, whiny jerk. I'm just someone who doesn't have much money this month, and my dog is sick, but because of little stuff like this, I have to choose my dog or 15 years of data.Date of experience:January 07, 2024",7,Laura Blackler,1,United States,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000000,worth allow sick hard available lose minimum driving complacent bottom last last next loyal bottom pathetic whiny much sick little choose,Negative

I was never able to successfully log in to Apple TV, trying to cancel so subscriptions wouldn't be collected has taken a full morning, cut off during Chat...just not good enough and puts me off ever considering the purchase of any Apple products...I believe the issue is that when I made my purchase at Currys.co.uk I used a CC that expired a few days post purchase. The replacement card was same number but new security code. I was required to use the CC details to set up Apple TV + account but because security code was different it caused a glitch in setting up account and there was no other options available to bypass this. I never got to use my free subscription. It demonstrates how poor Apple IT is, you're reputed to be the world IT leader, not according to my experience.Date of experience:December 31, 2023",5,Ian Shuttleworth,1,United Kingdom,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000000,difficult nightmarish free able full good used new different available use free poor,Positive
"Terrible quality of product and assistance.Quality of products and assistance is terrible. I bought a macbook pro in 2021 with the new system, which was supposed to be great. But, as always first version of new machines with Apple are just test-out. They make you pay to try their products at your own risk. I paid a premium price for this mac, yet, yesterday it stopped to accept my password (althought it works on my other macbook). Schedulled a call today, have been waiting for 4 hours, the technician put my macbook on recover mode and then ended the call and closed the case. Now, I am stuck with the macbook that doesnot work. it is impossible to reach the technical department. I risk loosing all my materials. She did not even ask if I had a backup of my materials.

"iPhone 15 should be recalledWhat happened Apple?  I have always recommended their iPhones, but I can’t do that anymore. I bought an iPhone 15 for my daughter and granddaughter. One was bought from Spectrum and the other directly from Apple. In less than a year the backs have cracked on both of them. The adult kids were afraid to tell me. Both are on some type of repair plan, but the fact these phones cost twice as much as my laptop, is inexcusable. The inconvenience is a real bitc. I can’t find word any other way to say this since both kids live in a rural area and have to make time to get the iPhones fixed and find a way to the Apple Store, stand in line and wait a couple hours. This should never be a thing with a phone less than a year old.  I am purchasing myself a new phone, but it won’t be an Apple or a Samsung. Neither company takes responsibility. The iPhone 15 should be recalled. Shame on you for making such a fragile phone, something that gets used daily.  Screw the customer. The only thing Apple cares about is making that dollar.

Oh well, fair enough.So I booked in at Touchwood Solihull ( because the nearer Apple ""Premier"" in Leamington Spa is ""Premier"" because it charges more, it would seem.I made the 1 hour journey to Solihull and after a few rounds of ""could I move"" and ""stand over there"", the clever man diagnosed that I needed a new battery and showed me ""stock =  zero"" on a screen.So I said "" It's a shame you could not have worked that out when I signed in with my particular iPhone model and request""He started to tell me that that was somehow, technologically too tough for them to accomplish and I left before any words like ""bulls*t"" escaped my lips.It is flabbergasting how rubbish Apple are and their pompous and arrogant demeanour in their shops.So, still with a duff battery and not much in the mood to queue up for more dismissive treatment, nor waste my time and money moving around to receive it.Date of experience:December 21, 2023",14,Philip Rose,1,United Kingdom,2023-12-22 00:00:00.000000,arrogant stupid several wrong kept fair clever new particular tough rubbish pompous much queue dismissive receive,Negative

All of a sudden it simply stopped to work, vanished from the app store, so it can't be used, downloaded or updated anymore. Apple refused me any refund or compensation. Oh look, what a coincidence: there is actually now a different app dictionary on the Apple Store with the same logo, nearly the same name, with the exact same functions for only £17.99! So, surprise, surprise, I have no other choice but to buy it, uh? And in a few years, when this new app will stop to work to be replaced by another fairly similar one, I'll need to buy it again.

So just shy of around £50 for a new set.The family and I have been Apple users for years… considering another member of the family had theirs replaced at no cost under similar circumstances, I think this if very unfair and also shows double standards.If this is a common problem, customers should be made aware and there should be more in place to support customers with this product and issue.

"My Mother is Unable to Erase Her Old Phone Due a Locked iCloud AccountMy Mother had no issues with iCloud until about 2 weeks ago when her iPhone 13 Pro Max was updated to IOS 17.1.2. As a result of the update, Her iCloud Account got Locked as a result of failed password attempts which requires verification to unlock and reset the password which fails with every attempt that is made. She initially thought that the issue was due to her phone being outdated. When She Ordered a Brand New iPhone 15 Pro Max from T-Mobile as a trade in Upgrade which requires the old phone to be erased and shipped to them after setting up the new phone. As soon as She began to set the device up, the issue progressed to the point where she had to call T-Mobile to manually activate Her new phone as a result of failing to automatically activate the new phone and failing to deactivate the old phone during data transfer. After activating the new phone, T-Mobile transferred her to Apple Support where She ended up with a rude representative who immediately blamed her for the issues with the iCloud Account such as false claims of deleted data when She cannot even get into the iCloud Account with the old phone in recovery mode on iTunes to erase the data. He proceeded to tell her that this happens to a lot of users and basically there was nothing He can do to recover the iCloud account. When my mother ordered my iPhone 15 from the same carrier, I did not have any issues with data transfer nor phone number transfer with my old iPhone 11 through my iCloud Account. As a result of Her conversation with the representative, She cannot erase the data from Her old phone nor return it to T-Mobile as it requires account verification which ends up failing and sending a password reset request in which support would then fail to respond to the request as if it were being ignored by the representatives. She sent at least three requests and did not receive a response from support for 2 weeks when it should have been received within 24 hours as stated on the webpage. I also heard about the update leading to a black screen which can potentially make some devices unusable without iTunes, recovery mode, and iCloud. I'm Furious with the representative failing to come up with a resolution for the iCloud recovery issue. The phone costs $1200 with payments being up to $50 per month from T-Mobile as part of the trade in offer. A failed trade in would result in a significant increase in the phone bill and termination of the offer. If my mother were to go to the Apple Store, She would be sitting there for over 4 hours for one appointment only to be told that they cannot help Her. I think Apple owes IOS users money for all of the frustration that came with the IOS update because they cannot help IOS users when they need help recovering their devices or iCloud accounts that were affected by the update. I want Apple to employ another method that has been used in the past which can help recover or erase devices with an inaccessible Apple ID which is what's needed in the next patch that is released by Apple with IOS and the iTunes app on PC and Mac.Date of experience:December 09, 2023",3,Brenden McGuire,1,United States,2023-12-10 00:00:00.000000,unable old due pro update locked thought due ordered new pro old new device activate new new old new representative false old old representative old receive update black unusable furious representative come significant update update inaccessible next,Negative

Not only did they not reach out to me proactively to replace mine but when I went to the store because the airpods were literally breaking my ears with constant, ULTRA LOUD, buzzing noise, they told me that I was not eligible ANYMORE for a repair or replacement because it was passed the window... Are you kidding me? In what world a call back program has a ""window"", does a defect product magically disappear after time? I had to warn them that I would take legal action. After speaking with 4 people and prepping a legal threat letter, they finally accepted to replace it. I had to go to UPS to ship it to them. I insisted that I didn't want to get a refurbished model from the same - defective - model. They assured me that I would get a brand new, latest, whole new airpods pro. Then I saw in the repair shipping notification that they replaced only the earbuds, not the case... I called them back. The customer service incompetent agent on the phone who was ""in charge"" and placed the replacement request of my repair case told me that because of the way the repair was formatted in the first place, only the earbuds could be replaced.

The iPods have lost power after 3 hours and my iPhone screen requires the area to be tapped twice! Very annoying! My expectations, perhaps too high, well I spent £1k for them…about 48 months for iPhone and 30 months for iPods!

"Apple customer support centre do not care about their customersI am with apple for 9 years now. Changing phone to new model every 2 years. I bought iPhone 15 recently and got was working well for month or so. I observed 2 things yesterday -1) Phone is not getting charged with my charger in Car. While other IPhone of my spouse and daughters are getting charge as normal. This is despite I am using original charging cord received from Apple.2) Battery started draining with super fast speed despite all kill all sessions and Apple which were running....Almost better was draining 1% / minute. This is extremely abnormal with new phone.I called customer support they did not checked on my phone and ran some test and later suggested to visit Apple support centre. I took appointment and visited support centre yesterday. They also ram test. Agent suggested to set the phone to factory setting and he promised all Apps will be restored as it from cloud backup. only text message will be lost as this is not backed up. He cleared agreed than all my apps, in curtain non critical apps you store password as well and it was confirmed they it will work as it is. I agreed for resetting to factory setting. but nothing was reset right. Then was I was ask to download all apps and login....I had >100 apps and it was impossible to remember all. There are few data and files you had which I was not able to recover.I spoke to the location manager there....to my surprise he also confirmed...apple are there in iCloud but I need to download all, arrange as it was earlier in groups and folders and login every App.I told him that when I switch from old phone to new phone, Apple support centre on call use to transfer and replicate everything as it from old phone to new phone. This transition was always seamless and you will not get a feel of any change other than physical device. But store manager did not agreed and he said it is NOT possible. I had to leave store with disappointment. half a day of Sunday gone and you have the work on Sunday to get your phone back. Absolutely pathetic customer support.I tole him that this is possible and I did multiple time with help of 24x7 customer support when I switch from old phone to new phone, but as per Manager I met there, this is not possible.Regarding my battery drain problem, They said they cannot do anything unless they discover problems at their end. There are NO way for them to track the how the phone battery is behaving. This was absurd issue I discovered and they Apple is not ready for any support in this case.This problem is not persistent, hence in case this observed again, I have to through out my Apple phone and change phone with other non-Apple device.I think next time I have to record for long video 30 min to 1 hrs showing how the battery is draining for Apple users to be aware of.Few suggestions for Apple -# They need to have customer support staff better trained and communicate clearly.# Device mechanism to checks issue in detail and device tools for the same.I and my family is big Apple fan for last 9 years and all products we had is Apple (Phone, Mac, iPad), but this is disappointing experience which will make me think if we should shift out of Apple devices.Avinash NimjeDate of experience:December 02, 2023",1,Avinash Nimje,1,United States,2023-12-03 00:00:00.000000,new normal original battery super kill abnormal new cloud backed critical factory right impossible able old new old new seamless change physical possible leave pathetic possible multiple old new discover absurd ready next video aware trained big last disappointing,Positive

"Beats EarphonesAfter a lifetime of apple purchase I will never spend a single penny again.  Spending 240 on Beats earpods is insane to begin with however I needed something that would hold up on daily runs and likes the waterproof feature.  After 5 days of ownership the right earpod stopped working.  I went to apple and even though I had apple care I was told they needed to be sent back for repair.  They were returned promptly with the same issue present.  After calling customer support again I was told I needed to pay a deposit on my credit card and they would get me replacements.  Once the replacements were back they would credit me.  Annoying but understandable.  These replacements worked for about a week however the right stopped charging again.  At this point I was able to determine that it was the charge case and set a appointment up with the local store.  Again they had to send them back but I marked the charge case.  Upon the shipment back to me I noticed the charge case was still the exact same it was not replaced.  I am now on the phone again trying to get this taken care of.

"The worst Apple Support experience everI purchased an Apple Watch Ultra 2 in NYC to be used in France. Before purchasing the watch, I obtained conflicting information (from Apple Support and from Apple staff) on whether it would be compatible in Europe. Nevertheless, I went ahead and purchased the watch but then decided to return the watch but was convinced otherwise by Apple sales staff . They guaranteed me that the watch will absolutely work in Europe (the Ultra 2 had one model only A2986 for Europe and the US as opposed to the older Ultra that had one for each region). A week later, armed with my new watch in France, I proceeded to activate it but couldn’t get the cellular service to work so I called Apple Support to get assistance and there again I received conflicting information: initially I was told that the watch should work in France (with service provider Orange) but by the end of the call I was told to exchange the watch in a local Apple shop (about an hour away by car) for a “European” model. So I did just that (had to wait for a week for the model to arrive in the shop then go and collect it again). The model i received was exactly the same model i retuned (A2986). So I activate the watch, then same problem occurred again (no cellular service). I called Apple Support again and was told to check with my service provider (Orange). This was never suggested during my first call with Apple Support ! Anyway, I called Orange to highlight the issue and within 24 hours the Apple Watch started to work properly.In conclusion, highlighting my entire experience, I spent over 8 hours with Apple Support over the phone, drove 75km to the local Apple Shop, exchanged a watch that should have never been exchanged, was without a watch for over a week thanks to (or really no thanks) to Apple Support.

For almost 4 weeks and several tries Apple Sweden hasn’t been able to even complete the simplest task to send their own shipping box (including a address label to their facilities) trough UPS and then to the correct address.There's nothing wrong with the goodwill of the support, but you have both big problems being action-oriented and solution-focused or taking on an honest personal responsibility to help your customer all the way - but are very happy to pass the responsibility on to someone else, or, as is usually the case - no one at all. The greatest focus seems to be placed on, like AI bots - according to a pre-written template, telling the same things over and over again, as well as spending a lot of time telling ""that from now on they will take over the case"" from ex. employee ""to ensure that I, as a customer, feel secure that this person undertakes my case"" and so on and so on...After the same procedure, having to, via Apple's support app, now every day for a month have to end up in the lap of a new employee, tell the same story - and then ""have to be taken over from another employee"" is starting to become damn frustrating and time-consuming now.I just want my damn headphones PICKED UP and then SENT IN, REPAIRED and then SENT back to me again.

And now the Macbook is having the same keyboard issues. It all well and good Apple having a recall program to replace the design faulty keys/keyboards but you should have resolved the keyboard design and fitted a modified keyboard fit for purpose, not just fit the same dodgy keyboard and expecting a different result.

To me it’s a scam being it happened to two phone in two year time frame.  Tech told me that I should have back up phone available in my case that would mean purchasing two phones because other phone went to black screen. He also said when you buy a car and take off lot they break buyer beware.  I said all the cars I bought for decades they loan you a car till your is fixed. It’s a scam if it happened once is one thing but twice is another. I will not buy three Apple phones in two years at $800 to $1200 a pop. It’s a scam.

"Apple’s Lack of Accountability and Unjustified Price HikesWhile contacting Apple customer support about the 44% increase in Apple TV+, it brought back the previous incident I had with Apple Support and their lack of action to deal with issues of poor service, App fraud and unjustified price hikes.  Let me explain:I had purchased a one time/life time subscription to TapeACall Pro via Apple App Store. 22 months after purchasing TapeACall, they secretly charged my account $0.00 in order to change the subscription type I had, so that they could begin charging me a monthly fee. I contacted Apple and proved everything I am saying now. They told me they were not responsible, it was the App developer. I contacted the App developer who said I had to contact Apple. I provided emails to Apple to confirm this. Apple then said they are not responsible for what the developers do. I could not understand this at all as Apple is the one who sells the App. If you go to Walmart and buy a lamp that doesn’t work, you return it to Walmart. Walmart doesn’t tell you that it’s not their responsibility to correct this, that it’s the manufacturer.No other entity, nearly as big, as big, or bigger than Apple, has a policy where they hold no responsibility for what they sell. Apple Support Manager told me to make a review of the App on the App Store, I did - nothing happened. They said leave feedback on their website, I did - nothing happened. This was the senior support manager who was telling me this. Please understand, complaints, feedback and issues are put in a void that provides no response or intent to resolve. So why would anyone purchase anything from the Apple App Store knowing they refuse to be responsible… the Support Manager even told me there had been a plethora of complaints about this App, yet they kept selling it.If Apple doesn’t feel they have a fiduciary responsibility to either be responsible or hold the App developer responsible then I suggest Apple shouldn’t be able to sell anything that is from a third party. Imagine you went to the movies and purchased a drink with unlimited refills, but when you went to get a refill they said you had to pay for it. When you explain, and prove, that you were sold unlimited refills they tell you to contact Coke/Pepsi or leave the complaint on a feedback card (that no one ever looks at). Furthermore, they refuse to give you a refund and they continue selling drinks with unlimited refills that don’t actually have refills. Would you ever go back to that theatre?So now Apple has raised their Apple+ Tv subscription by 44%, but haven’t increased new content. In fact their new content has decreased. Additionally, they are now more expensive than Disney+ and Prime Video, but have a fraction of the content. There is no loyalty incentive or even a justification for the price increase. They are banking on being “Apple” and that people will just put up with it. There are many other large companies that thought they were to big to fail - Kodak, Blockbuster, Polaroid, Xerox and so many more.Knowing that inflation has gone up at nearly record levels, Apple has decided now is the time to increase their price - not just increase it at inflation rates, but instead 6 times the pinnacle inflation rate recently experienced.I have cancelled my Apple Subscription,  When it’s time to upgrade I will be buying an Android device, probably a Samsung or Google phone and will leave Apple in my rear view. In the age of customer experience, a company that has zero respect for the consumer should not expect any loyalty (think about them being caught purposefully slowing down phones in order to prompt consumers to buy a newer model).I’ll end with what I said to the Customer service representative and the Manager; why would I stay with Apple, when I’m doing way more for Apple than Apple does for me? As my devices age (laptop, wireless headphones, smart watch, tablet), I will replace these devices with other brands. I hope that more consumers who have negative experiences with Apple do the same. It’s the only way they will change.Date of experience:November 08, 2023",1,Michael Rosenby,1,Canada,2023-11-09 00:00:00.000000,unjustified previous poor unjustified account monthly responsible responsible lamp big big leave senior void fiduciary responsible responsible able third unlimited unlimited give unlimited new content new expensive prime many large big many upgrade android prompt representative wireless smart negative,Positive

"Apple your customer service is just awfulFirstly, it looks like Apple don’t reply on Trustpilot!This may seem a very small annoyance, but here goes.I took out an extra 50gb of data to just back up my photos I have.  Well, looking back on PayPal they have taking a payment twice a month!Got onto their customer services via their app, and at the end of it all, my blood pressure was well up.He then said (apple customer service) you have an app and it’s ££9.99 a year.Yes I said, but it goes out on the 15th of September for a one off payment of £9.99!!!I said Apple must have my payments record, he said he can only see 2 months back?I then get asked can you send me photographs from your records, I do and still he says can’t see them all.Who are these people working for this company?It looks like 2 years of double payments.I have asked for a supervisor to ring, you couldn’t make it up.Date of experience:November 04, 2023",1,Misskitteecat,1,United Kingdom,2023-11-05 00:00:00.000000,small extra double,Negative
"Apple Macbook - I don't own my device. Apparently Apple doesMy Apple Macbook device got broken after 4 years of usage. I brought it to the repairs. Good thing they managed to repair it, but they needed to reinstall the system. After reinstall, Apple device asks to login into Apple ID. I used my PC for 4-5 years and Apple ID was not used, so I forgot the password. Now to recover my password, I need to wait for 2 weeks, even though I have access to my email and my phone number. Apple support over the phone, can't do anything. I even asked them, that I can send a scan of passport. This would proof 100%, that device was mine, as email corresponds to my credentials. I am very dissapointed with Apple. It looks like, even though I spend my money buying their device. I still can't control it fully. They can lock my device.

"Never thought of looking at reviews of…Never thought of looking at reviews of Apple Inc on TP. Was staggered to see such a poor rating for a company that has led the way in customer service, free ‘in-store’ and ‘online training’, and  followed by other companies as the ‘gold standard’. I’ve used Apple gear since 1996 and can honestly say every item of equip I’ve ever had (and they run into many of all types) don’t owe me a penny and have always performed as you’d expect and lasted many years. I’m still using a 2010 Mac Book Pro in everyday use!! I do wonder about some reviews, this one for instance from Oct 2023:‘Bought apple ipod pro from apple store, thinking that i could use my iPhone 14 charging cable no where said i couldn’t.Pods arrived and blow me down a different socket so i cant use my cable i already have so have to buy charging matNo where do you tell me this on purchase!Apple just money grabbing!Seriously considering swopping to another make of phone’.Well, there is no such item now as iPod Pro, maybe he means an iPad Pro? It comes with a charging lead (but not a charger) in the box. Then he says ‘Pods arrived… so does he mean EarPods? EarBuds come in a case that charges the buds, once again with a lead to charge them. I do think some people just love attacking Apple. Reviewers talk about software slowing the phone down, in my experience and I’ve had at least 6 iPhones now I’ve never had issues like that. I have many friends who often ask me about minor issues with their devices and again none have ever reported these. I know there have been issues but not on the scale that some of these reviewers claim.

I'm almost certain they have their AI set up for who will be waiting for weeks and who they'll verify right away. Their garbage. I will never ever buy another apple product in my life. On top of that I'm demolishing my Apple iPhone when I'm done with it instead of selling it or trading it in.  Apple is definitely overrated and I'm glad they did that so I can see there true colors.

Imagine if people wake up and realize that they're being overcharged for a phone that does the same thing a $200 phone does and is designed just like all the other phones.

"The apple experienceI have cancer. I am supposed to lower my stress, but I am making myself sick dealing with Apple and this bull. I almost passed out walking out the mall and crashed when I got home to print yet another document missing my 3rd appointment at the apple store. This will be my fifth time going into the store to prove it's my phone. They don't check ids or passports or me logging into my account and showing them I own the phone. NOPE, they want a printed piece of paper that shows the phone was mailed to me. Three different people at the store gave me 3 different requests for what they need in a document. I am officially being given the run around. The first person said proof I own it. Brought that in to be told it needs to have the date I purchased it. Which get this, it was on the first one. So I brought a second one, the contract I signed for the phone. No we need a receipt, proof that it was shipped to you and how much you paid for it. All on the contract and Huh, so when I pushed back I was told it has to have the imei number on it WHICH WAS ON THE FIRST ONE.What is this! Thieves would have an easier time getting my phone fixed than I do. The person who owns it. Bought it and pays for it every month. Sporting the watch it's linked to, but that means nothing. In fact I have a legacy contact. If something happens to me, heaven forbid, she would have an easier time getting my information from apple than I do.Is this reality I am living in!Apple is useless!! My phone is broken and I'm locked out of my apple Id now. Which, now this is my favorite part, I have the apple key but it NO LONGER WORKS ON APPLE'S NETWORK. It only works from the device itself... my broken device I can't fix because I can't prove it was shipped to me. I have to prove I ordered the phone to get the phone fixed to get in the phone to use the key which can only be used in the broken phone.I hope reading that gave you a headache and made you go Wth. Then you'll be somewhat closer to where I am mentally right now. The man on the phone with support response was, ""yeah you shouldn't have done that (create the key) because they JUST changed the policy. There always changing the polices so this is new."" Get this, apple is the one who told me to get create the key when I bought the phone!I have an apple watch which stopped working and wouldn't let me unlock my phone, also not proof that it's my phone. They legit asked me if I had another apple device that I can use to unlock my phone, which wouldn't have worked anyway, but why seriously because the first two products are working so well! I was going to buy an iPad. But thank GOD I didn't!The first guy in the store actually told me to go home find a friend with an apple device to help me reset my password. So when I called apple customer service online and got the 3rd person, she was like, ""the APPLE store couldn't help you change your password!?? They have apple devices for this very reason."" I was like SISSSSSSSS!! She started laughing and apologized but ""that's the dumbest thing I ever heard."" Bruh!!!!!! This was the only ""genius"" I have spoken with at apple. This last genius legit looked me in my face and said, "" we just want to prove it's your phone."" Bruh where is an attorney when you need one! I ask myself everday how is this my life right now. I woke up one morning, phone on the charger completely dead. Thinking its probably just a battery issue. The tech told me they have the part and it will take an hour to fix but I need the login information. Now, I'm playing a horrible game of whose phone is it really. I am exhausted, and for me that means a whole lot right now. As a person with medical issues who lives alone, this is a dangerous place to be and I am going on day 6 without access.

"CapitalismI've been using a MacBook Pro for a while now, and I was always happy with it until last weekend. I was working on my laptop on Saturday when, for no apparent reason, the screen started flickering. I contacted Apple support, but they informed me that I would have to address this issue myself because it's out of warranty. I'm quite disappointed with Apple since I invested $3,500 in what I expected to be a reliable tool.Now, my only option is to send it back to Apple, which will cost me even more money. The frustrating part is that they've designed the laptop in a way that makes it impossible to replace just the cable connecting the screen to the laptop; I'd have to replace the entire screen, even though it still functions properly when at the right angle.Apple is asking for another $1,300 to make it work again. It's not just about the money; it's also about the inconvenience of not having my laptop for 2 or 3 weeks. I run an online business, and this issue is affecting it significantly. It's also a waste of resources, transportation, and energy. I'm truly disappointed with Apple. I thought I was buying a quality product.

The person I got on the other end of the chat was devoid of logic and brimming with arrogance. ‘We’ve got millions of orders to process’. Ok, I got it- I am a very small number in Apple’s world. The reviews I’ve seen on the 15 Pro looked pretty lukewarm at best. I hadn’t envisaged them being inundated with millions of orders.

I did and the manager was dismissive too and explained that the AirPod charging case is the most expensive part. Ok… with that being said why are Apple care covers not designed for theft and lost on AirPods. Those AirPods cost the person who bought them for me £169 less than 6 months ago and they just sold me a new charging case for £79.

"Legalised Scam from the big one.If I could leave a zero I would. Having been an Apple user for many years I decided to buy two of the latest 15 pro max handsets. Coming in at £2400 gbp. So I decided to trade in two of there handsets. First one estimated at £350. Today came back with £100 and after a lengthy conversation with them, they are sending that handset back to me. The second estimate was for £580. I will update this review when I see what ridiculous offer comes back for this.  Both my trade ins were like new with no scratches of faults whatsoever.

"Apple is horribleI wanted to express my deep disappointment with my recent experience using Apple services and products. I believe it is essential to provide feedback when customers face issues, in the hope that it can lead to improvements in the future.Recently, I received a small sum of money (less than $100) via the Apple Cash app, which prompted a sudden and unexpected request for extensive personal information verification. This included my name, address, email, the last four digits of my social security number, and then also my full social security number. Understandably, given recent incidents of fraud on another credit card, I was skeptical about providing such sensitive information. Regrettably, my decision to test the system by entering ""123456789"" led to me being locked out of my Apple Cash account.Desperate to resolve the issue, I reached out to Apple Support earlier today, where I spoke with Richard and his supervisor, Alicia. To my disappointment, they informed me that I had been suspended from using Apple Pay, and there was no apparent way to lift this suspension. Furthermore, I learned that I couldn’t create a new account without using my social security number, a requirement that Apple strictly enforces.I've noticed a concerning decline in the overall quality of Apple's products and services. iPhones, which were once known for their reliability and innovation, appear to have lost their charm. Similarly, the experience with Apple's services has deteriorated, as evident in my recent ordeal with Apple Cash. This has left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration.Given the aforementioned issues, I've made the difficult decision to discontinue my use of Apple services and to part with all Apple products I own, including my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac, and Apple TV. It saddens me to take this step, as I have been a long-time Apple customer, but I feel it is necessary to protect my personal information and seek more reliable alternatives.I hope that my feedback can contribute to improving the experiences of other Apple users in the future. While I understand that no company is without its challenges, it is crucial that customers' concerns are addressed promptly and efficiently.Date of experience:October 06, 2023",5,R.G.

"Horrible customer serviceApple just want your money. I have the iPhone 12 Pro Max that I paid 1300€ two years ago. Apple claims it can go underwater for 30min at -6 meters. A few drops went on my screen and my phone crashed. I paid 450€ to repair the display. Then I noticed that the Face ID wasn’t working so I came back to the Apple Store and an employee told me the technical service will do it without extra cost. After a second diagnostic another employee told me I have to pay 260€ to change the Face ID camera. I had to come back 5 times because either they didn’t have the camera in stock, were late…Apple lies on the capacity of the iPhone regarding its waterproof abilities and if you have an issue it’s of course not included in the guarantee.I asked if I can have a new iPhone at -400€ since I paid the repair and they told me that I can’t.I’m a loyal customer for more than 10 years.

"Not worth wasting time on preordersI have made my first and last preorder with Apple.  I had to fill out the order form 3 times because it kept entering my old information from prior purchases.  I elected to purchase the protection plan for the new iPhone 15 Pro Max which was not to be billed to my bank until the said new phone had been activated.  The receipt I received (sent to an old email address; not the current address I put on the order form) only gave an order number and the name of the item I purchased; no shipping address.The expected ship date was given as between 10/09/23 and 10/15/23 (I preordered on 09/15/23).  I received a notification for fraudulent activity from my bank on 10/03/23 because Apple had billed my first protection plan fee even before the phone was even shipped, much less activated.  When I contacted Apple regarding the charge, their only remedy to the problem was to cancel the protection plan and said I had 60 days to reapply after I received the phone.I also received an email (once again to the old email address) on 10/03/23 that my phone was being prepared for shipment and provided a tracking number.  When I tracked it, they had sent it to an old address and not the address I entered on the order form.  Another 45 minutes on the phone with Apple and the representative said he would request an address change to the shipping company.  Another email (yes, you guessed it - sent to the old email address) said they had contacted the shipping company but there was no guarantee that it would actually change.  At that time, the tracking number was showing a delivery date if 10/05/23.  Since then, the tracking only shows “Delay” or “ Mechanical Failure”.  So I guess my phone will float around in China for a while.The entire preorder process was more trouble than it is worth.  Apple clearly needs to pay attention to individual order information and act accordingly.  Just because an email address and shipping address was one thing 3 years ago does not mean they are still current.  I am very disappointed with the Apple corporation, and I will never place another preorder with them again.  Less problematic to wait until the new phones hit the carrier stores.Date of experience:October 03, 2023",6,Anonymous,1,United States,2023-10-05 00:00:00.000000,last old new new sent old current notification fraudulent first old sent old old shipping mechanical entire individual address current disappointed problematic new,Positive

"Apple Store on George Street is the WORST SHOP IN CITY.I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with the terrible experience I had at the Apple Store on George Street in Sydney.I arrived around 9:20 AM, approximately one hour after receiving the notification that my order was ready for pickup. I joined the queue and checked in with the staff, as per the usual procedure. I specifically requested that they install the screen protector for me. To my astonishment, the employee who checked me in informed me that the screen protector they sell in-store, which they can install, is different from the one I had purchased online. He stated that they couldn't install the one I bought online. This came as a complete surprise, and I asked him what could be done. He suggested they would refund my online purchase and provide me with the in-store screen protector, which they could install. I found it odd that this information was not conveyed online during my purchase, but I agreed to the change.However, what followed was a wait of an excruciating one hour with no progress. I complained multiple times to both the initial employee and other team members, but they repeatedly apologized and asked me to wait. When I arrived at the store, the queue only consisted of me and two others, and when I left, it was still just a few more customers waiting. Meanwhile, I observed many other customers buying phones and getting their screen protectors installed on the spot. My frustration reached its limit, and I demanded my order without the installation. Again, I was asked to wait. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my order was handed over.To my disbelief, I noticed an installer standing idle for more than 10 minutes after I had received my order. I approached him, hoping to purchase a new screen protector and have it installed, but he informed me that I would have to wait another 20-30 minutes. I couldn't comprehend this, as I had already waited for an hour. He insisted that he had other customers to attend to. This was beyond frustrating.I escalated the issue to the manager, but to my dismay, he echoed the same response. This level of disrespect is utterly unacceptable. I understand that spending $2000 at the Apple Store doesn't make me their most important customer, but why couldn't they simply install the screen protector when I had already waited for an hour, and their installer was just standing idle?This experience is a disgrace to Apple and stands in stark contrast to the sleek and customer-friendly image that their advertisements portray.Date of experience:September 28, 2023",1,Shan AF,1,Australia,2023-09-30 00:00:00.000000,disappointed terrible ready usual install informed different complete odd multiple initial many screen idle new screen dismay unacceptable understand important screen idle sleek,Negative

Had lots of freezing, apps error and closing, hangings on loading iOS apps (not those from App Store). So there is went the myth with the perfect smartphone OS. I liked though that I could hear calls a bit better than on an Android smartphone I'm using in parallel. The speaker also sounds more bassy...2. AirPods 3rd Gen: I like them, they sound good, but not very loud. The battery depleted by itself many times, when not used. So I must charge them every week or so. I use some Huawei mostly, because they connect to two devices at once. The AirPods can't do that. And it's annoying.3. MacBook Air M1 (8GB, 256GB): I liked the MacOS. Mostly a good experience for programming, browsing, multimedia. Good speakers. But something I wasn't expecting: if (and I do lots of times) I have too many tabs opened in the browser, the browser (at least) freezes completely. I must to Force Quit the app from the Task Manager or what's called. When the RAM is full many apps are hanging too and it becomes useless. And I can't upgrade the RAM. And to buy 32GBs of RAM unit is out of discussion. It's extremely expensive. I'll have my Lenovo Legion 5 with 64GB of RAM and 3TBs on SSDs doing the hard job. Ahh, forgot: compared to Windows, waking the MacBook from sleeping mode happens instantly. This is really nice.4. iPad Mini 6 WiFi 64GB/ 5G & WiFi 256GB: bought the WiFi version to use it for navigation, as compared to an Android tablet it takes both Apple Maps and Google Maps (both they do great job). Learned the expensive way that the WiFi version doesn't have a GPS module. Lol. The cheapest possible Android tablet I ever had, it had GPS. You just tether your smartphone's WiFi and voilà, you have internet on the tablet. Not on the WiFi version of this iPad Mini 6. So had to buy the Cellular version again. The latest works just fine. Lags sometimes with both navigation apps opened on split screen, but it's ok.5. iPad Pro 11 M1 2021 (8GB RAM, 128GB ROM): bought this for gaming and it's a monster. I even edited some videos and this thing is fast. Bought for my brother the Galaxy Tab S8 (8GB RAM, 256GB ROM, 5G) and the Samsung has more options for the user (Samsung DEX at least) and it came with a keyboard AND the pen. All for under 600£ with student price. Anyway, I still like iPad Pro. I bought a Logitech keyboard, as the original is way too expensive to worth. I'd buy the pen, but 120£? Really?Anyway, to end my review for Apple: it's just another company trying to lure the customers into buying their products. It's all about the money. But it's far from any perfection some fans are bragging.Before buying the 13 Mini, I bought a SE202 to see how's an iPhone. I had AppleCare+ for it. And sold it, but cancelling the Coverage can't be done through Apple platform. Must call them and it's hugely annoying. It's not something straight.Date of experience:October 10, 2022",1,Florin M.,4,United Kingdom,2023-09-27 00:00:00.000000,good good good disappointed perfection myth perfect better good loud many connect good good many full many useless ram expensive hard bought android great expensive possible android tablet cellular fine navigation screen pro fast pen pro original expensive pen anyway,Positive

"Saved up for the new flagship IPhone 15…Saved up for the new flagship IPhone 15 Pro Max at a hefty cost of £1200.Just cancelled my order and I want to share why with other prospective buyers.There is a major problem with overheating on all 15 models where the phone becomes too hot to hold even in its case with lab tested temperatures of up to 116f.There is a further serious problem with the extreme fragility of the glass back on the new series allegedly because the new titanium shell is super strong and inflexible placing untold pressure on the glass back if dropped or slightly bent. This problem is compounded by the fact Apple have removed the steel plate protecting the back on previous models.Needless to say I am going to go for the 14 Pro Max if and when the prices drop!Date of experience:September 27, 2023",5,Simon Lidstone,1,United Kingdom,2023-09-27 00:00:00.000000,new new flagship pro prospective major hot serious new new strong inflexible untold bent previous go pro,Positive

"Terrible Experience with Apple Refurbished WebsiteI wanted to buy an iPad for my daughter.  She had a gift card that I was using (with her permission), which limited the choices I had; most new iPads were more expensive, and I opted to try the Apple website that offered refurbished iPads.  Note that this was an official Apple website, not a third-party one.It was a terrible experience, and I would advise anyone to avoid using this site.I first tried to order an 8th-generation iPad in Space Gray, the color my daughter preferred.  The item was shown as available on the website. The cost was acceptable given the amount of her gift card.  The order appeared to go through, but a day later, I was advised that the order was canceled.  I called Apple and was told that unfortunately the Space Gray was out of stock.  Worse, Apple had put a ""hold"" on the amount of the purchase, and I had to wait for that to clear before I could use the full amount of the gift card again.Forewarned by this experience, I first called Apple to check that the next color choice for this generation of iPad (silver) was in stock.  I was told it was.  Once the hold on the card cleared, I ordered the silver.  Apple accepted the order, and I received an email saying the order was ""in process"" and was projected to be delivered on a certain date.  That date passed without any progress on the order. I then received an email saying that THIS order was canceled.  I called Apple again and was told, again, that the color was out of stock.  Another ""hold"" was placed on the gift card and, as of 2 days after the cancellation, the hold is still in effect, preventing me from buying an iPad somewhere else.I have used Apple products for years and have been very happy with their design and functionality.  However, this experience has undermined my confidence that Apple cares about its customers.  This borders on improper consumer practices.True, my daughter has not lost any money - this would be consumer fraud - but the time and effort I've spent trying to buy a product that appeared to be available (or was confirmed to be available) on Apple's website was completely wasted, and my daughter still does not have an iPad.Again, I advise you not to expect the Apple refurbished website to be reliable or able to fulfill your orders.Date of experience:September 23, 2023",4,Bill Mack,1,United States,2023-09-28 00:00:00.000000,terrible new expensive official terrible gray available acceptable gray hold full hold certain happy experience improper available available expect reliable able,Positive

"pathetic service and productI want to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the recent purchase of an iPhone 15 Pro. It has been nothing short of a nightmare.I eagerly bought the iPhone 15 Pro yesterday with high hopes, only to be met with a barrage of issues as soon as I got home. The very basic task of transferring files from my old phone to the new one proved to be a Herculean challenge. In my desperate attempts to resolve this matter, I contacted your support team, who suggested subscribing to a monthly iCloud backup service for a fee of 3 pounds. I complied, thinking this would be the solution to my problems, only to find out that it did not resolve the issue.Upon contacting your support team for the second time, I was recommended to transfer the files via my Mac. To my dismay, this too proved to be futile. I have spent an excruciating 1.5 days trying to achieve what should have been a straightforward task.It wasn't until my fourth contact with your customer support that I was informed that the problem lies with the software on the new phone. This revelation left me utterly frustrated and disappointed. I decided to visit your store with hopes of getting a replacement, but to my astonishment, I was denied the opportunity to thoroughly inspect the replacement device to ensure it was functioning correctly. I left the store empty-handed, having wasted 7 pounds on parking, 10 pounds on fuel, and an additional 3 pounds on iCloud services.This weekend has been a deplorable experience, marred by incompetence and a lack of support. It is especially disheartening considering the substantial amount of money I have invested in Apple products, including watches and laptops, over the years.I implore you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and restore my faith in Apple's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.Date of experience:September 23, 2023",16,TOMAS,1,United Kingdom,2023-09-24 00:00:00.000000,pathetic express recent short pro high old new desperate resolve second futile spent achieve fourth new replacement astonishment inspect additional deplorable substantial immediate,Negative

Since I was on vacation couldnt do that. So, Once  I returned to Doha , Qatar from where the phone was purchased, I was told by the Apple service center that the camera had come in contact with a laser,which is ABSURD, and it was not covered under the one year warranty.

"Apple Canada don’t care about the environmentOn the 12 of September I bought online a MacBook Pro.  I received later an email with a tracking number that the item was shipped.

"Great until it just stops working.I have never had an issue with a computer before.  Not ever.  My previous MacBook Pro worked until the keyboard pads were literally worn through.  Trade in and a new MacBook Pro. Only a year later it broke for no reason. The logic board just fried itself.  No spills, no bangs, not using the computer for anything excessive.  $700 repair later?It kept crashing and less than a year later? The logic board fried itself again.  No reason.  It was literally working one day and broken the next, again.Apple would like to replace the exact same part for another $700.  This would be the third logic board in as many years.  That is a total cost of $4,400 to have a computer than might be functional again for another year?  What!?!Worse?  You can quickly find reviews indicating that multiple customers are having the same problem while Apple plays dumb.If customers pay premium prices for computers, they should be getting a computer that actually works.I feel like I got absolutely robbed by Apple.  No one at Apple cares in the least that a premium computer is blowing out for absolutely no reason - all they seem to care about is getting access to my wallet.I’d like a computer that actually works if I am paying five times the rate for a computer.There is literally nothing I could have done differently with this computer and it’s fried … again.  There is literally nothing I could do to take better care of it and Apple is absolutely fine with selling guys like me junk that breaks for no reason.

"Apple Was Once Superior at Customer ServiceApple was once superior at customer service, but their service has dropped significantly, to the point that we as a business made a decision to switch back to MS Windows products. We purchased two iMacs from Apple in Oct 2022. Six months later, the motherboard failed. We returned for repair, and two months later, motherboard failed again. We requested a refund since obviously this one computer was a lemon (second computer has been fine), Apple has refused, and wishes for us to again return computer for repair. The time required to deal with this issue has cost of more than the $2500 we spent on the computer itself. It's a shame. We like Apple as a company, but they no longer stand behind their products as they once did.Date of experience:September 20, 2023",33,Reed Swearingen,2,United States,2023-09-20 00:00:00.000000,superior superior second,Positive

So wasted that time too.I want my time, energy and money back.Update:I went to the Apple Store with an appointment in Sydney CBD. The experience continued with the lady there only able to give a refund. They didn’t help to exchange or order the replacement. So it would have been let to me to sit on the double credit card balance and re order risking that they had no inventory in stock. So not really helping the customer. She kept telling me the count of how many times she told me they don’t have stock in the store. No initiative to help!I did get lucky and another lady helped to order online and use a gift card to avoid the double credit card hit. That was a better way than the first robotic like behaviour of the first lady.

Sure, their products are rarely the most innovative on the market, but Apple has, in my personal opinion, the most polished products on the market.

Apple is the best when it comes to the long life cycles of their products, and that's what you pay for.

"Apple MusicApple Music engages in highly misleading marketing.AM offered me a 3 months free trial, then, as soon as my acceptance was forthcoming, AM cut the free period from 3 months to 1 month.

The AM employee I spoke to initially on 31st August first of all suggested that the emailed offer I had received might have somehow emanated from someone other than AM (really?!!) and then claimed that he did not to have the necessary authority to resolve my complaint (even though a two month extension to the free subscription period has a retail value of all of £21.98!).At the end of my conversation with AM's Manager Roberto on 31st August, I was asked to send a further copy of AM's marketing email (which I did); I was also asked to telephone them once again after re-sending the email.

If you are using maps, games, anything you can name, that button will always be there to f##k up whatever you're doing. And the only way to turn that off is by pressing the power button three times to turn on some idiot, privacy mode which freezes you in the current app and the only way to get out is to press the button three times again and put in a passcode. and yes, you are correct, EVERY TIME. so if you want to privately play a game or app, you have to go through that god awful process.Just bring back the home button, it really does make your product exponentially better.Another thing, I am attempting to set up a genius bar appointment, but my phone is disconnected from cellular AND wifi cause my iPhone 12, like I said, is just a brick with pretty colors.

"Be wary of Apple’s customer service …I have been an Apple supporter and buyer for many years I have all the Apple gadgets. That being said I am very disappointed recently with their customer service or lack of customer service. Everything is very rigid and you have to adapt to Apple. There is no way to give a negative feedback and only through Apple’s feedback service which says your feedback will be dealt with and you won’t be contacted. What is the point of filing a complaint if you won’t get the respect back from Apple to deal directly with you on this issue. To get refunds from Apple Store for Apps that they offer it’s all automated and fixed to limited reasons so personal circumstances aren’t dealt with and you won’t get any reason why your refund is rejected other than it’s part of their terms and conditions. The chat always push you to having calls with customer service senior advisors and some try and help but again others just say sorry read our terms and conditions. This is against the entire remit of transparency and consumer laws in Ireland. For example in Ireland you are entitled to 14 day cancellation for any service and that includes purchases in Apps and a full breakdown of what you bought. This didn’t happen and Apple customer service refused to hear me out or file a detailed complaint calling out their non compliance with Irish and EU law. Today I was offered randomly for a previous purchase of Apple Music for 6 months. I spent hours trying to get this sorted even had to contact my bank and the issue is with apple but again they say they want me to waste more time and have a senior adviser deal with matters via a call. So again limited to what Apple wants. The service and products to be honest or Apple have reduced in quality. My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is very disappointing as well. At this stage I amThinking of selling all my apple products and moving to Samsung. Honestly it’s disappointing how rigid Apple is in nit even allowing you to file complaints that will actually be dealt with.Date of experience:September 08, 2023",24,Sana  Khan,1,Ireland,2023-09-08 00:00:00.000000,wary many disappointed rigid negative respect limited personal senior sorry read entire full happen non previous contact senior disappointing rigid,Negative

I was charged for $12.71 although I didn’t have a subscription and I call apple and ask wat was this transaction for and apple could not tell me the customer service rep even took control over my phone on a app just to see if I have any active subscription that I was not seeing, and still couldn’t see wat was the 12.71 so I had to lock my card so it wouldn’t charge me, I even change my card 4 time and it still try to bill the new card with the old card information. The supervisor said she saw the $12.71 trying to bill me but because it never actually bill me she can’t tell me what is it for, so I said ok just bill me let see what it is. She (the supervisor) said I need to let it charge me before they can tell me what it was im being charge for because I didn’t have an active subscription. Now I let u guys charge me they wouldn’t give me back my money. It’s charged $12.71 then it charges $10.59 for two inactive app and the same day it charges I call and request a refund and the going to say ineligible, although the supervisor could not tell me, what was the charges for to begin with, This is unfair and criminals. So Apple stole my money for an app that I’m not even using And was not subscribe for at the moment. When I called Apple, I explain to them about the whole situation and they was like the building department made their final decision and I will not be getting about my money so I said you guys told me to let it charge me so we can see what the transaction was about Well the customer service manager says there was no way of getting a refund and I was like so Apple stole from me and he was like there is no refund. There is no way possible that you will ever get a refund and there’s nothing they can do about it and the billing team that make that decision is noway that I can talk to them.The consumer provided the following when submitting the Complaint to BBB.

"Iphone 8 plus battery changeI have an iPhone 8 plus and it’s been running perfect apart from the battery life. I decided to get the battery changed at the Apple store in Southampton. First of all I was told I arrived 3 minutes early and had to hang around. Then someone told me when I went to see another customer advisor to wait in the Genius area. Another guy came out and told me that Apple was updating to IOS17 in a months time and my phone would not accept the update, did I still want to go ahead. Then another customer advisor came out to check the phone status. I decided still to get the battery changed to get some extra life out of the phone. When I came to pick my phone up another advisor told me that it now doesn’t work and they were sorry for the inconvenience. So a simple battery change by an authorised Apple store has left me without a phone. They expect to get me a phone in the next 5 days.

"Apple shops need to display prices in their storesApple shops need to display prices in their shops. Terrible experience. My wife suffers with arthritis and needed to buy a new iPad due to dropping her old iPad several times. Sadly we arrived late after travelling 76 miles from mid Wales. We could not be seen for 15 minutes so we looked at the various iPads on display. When the sales person arrived, we explained that we wanted exactly the set up displayed. An iPad 10 instead of a 9 as my wife liked the keyboard with the 10. The salesman checked and said that there were no p8nk ones in stock. However, one could be sent to our home the next day. After difficulty with the pay machine, the deed was done and the salesman had checked that the info would be transferred to iCloud. We are of the older generation but looked forward to receiving the package next day, despite the possible difficulty in setting up. The package arrived after lunch. Unfortunately, the package only contained the iPad. No keyboard which was an important part of the deal.we tried contacting Apple to discuss the situation. Three times the phone hung up when trying to speak to someone. The fourth time, we had an answer and as we gave the order number, the line went dead again. We then tried three other numbers on Google, including the complaints number. All cut us off once we started giving the information. We then tried one of the numbers again and actually managed to speak to someone. We had to ask for them to speak louder as we could barely hear them. Also, it was extremely difficult to understand the lady. We were then told that our address was wrong despite us giving them our address and the parcel arriving. We spelled out the details and strangely, our address was right. We were eventually told that we had only bought the iPad. We had stressed that the package on display was exactly what we needed. We eventually asked for them to collect the package as it was of no value without the keyboard. She explained that it would cost another two hundred pounds for the keyboard. She then put us through to someone else as she was an engineer. Eventually, it was agreed for Apple to send us labels and we would arrange it collected from our home. We would have to wait until the item reached their factory and was checked before any refund. This would take another 3-5 days to refund. Terrible service all round. They had offered for us to go back to the store to buy a keyboard. This would only have been another 150 miles round trip.

I checked my order thismorning to see the status of the shipping to see if it was out for delivery and it said it hadn’t even shipped yet!

Long story short, in the process of getting my account right. Apple has permanently locked my icloud account because it got locked three times within a couple months but it was all because of their bank. Nothing I did wrong. Now they have pretty much told me, that I'm pretty much screwed and there is nothing they can or will do. I have spoken to many people, some very helpful but this last time was the last straw. She told me that their was no one else I could speak to. She was it, the highest person I could speak to and she told me that it was there company policy and there was nothing they can do.

Over the next month it go a little worse. I then switched wrists. I knew something wasnt right but thought swapping wrists was the best plan. It wasnt.I then started to see the same rash appear, but this time i was quick to remover the watch and stopped wearing it.I've tried various over the counter creams, but nothing has worked.

"Unethical through and throughUnethical through and through. Apple used to make a lasting, quality product. My 5S was kicking for 5+ years. It was still working when I retired it for a 2020 SE after they started zapping battery life on old models (I don’t buy the explanation they fed us on that one by the way). Now they make them to last 2 years max. I hardly use my phone (texts and light browsing) and it just drains. If I’m sleeping and it’s unplugged, it can easily die on its own. Well, the old “inferior” 5S battery didn’t do that. It’s a shame their only goal is to sell as many devices as possible - that’s inherently unethical. I recommend looking up a list of what goes into making a smart phone. There are limited amounts of the elements required to produce electronic devices and smart phones on the earth. There is no game plan to recycle these precious metals from existing devices, slow down, or cease mining for these. Instead, every year there’s a new iPhone, regardless of how piddling and insubstantial the updates are on it. I am not advocating a Luddite, phoneless existence - I am just asking Apple be reasonable and build fewer, enduring products instead of a frenzied existence of endlessly churning out new products to make shareholders richer. Since my SE 2020 isn’t faring well, I stepped into an Apple Store to look at current offerings the other day. When I mentioned I was interested in an older model, the sales associated pretended to look shocked and said, “are you ok being X # of phones behind?”. What an awful sales tactic- trying to shame or pressure customers to buy the latest and greatest, to be “in” on the hype. It all makes me want to drop Apple versus continue to complicitly support their waste machine. No one can tell me Apple is any better than Bezos and Amazon in terms of ethics, other than having an absurd market share on smartphones.Date of experience:August 13, 2023",16,Gale,2,United States,2023-08-15 00:00:00.000000,unethical lasting se old last unplugged old inferior many possible unethical smart electronic smart precious slow new insubstantial reasonable new current interested pretended awful absurd,Positive

"THIEVES! They stole my money, then ignored me.Completely out of the blue £6.99 was debited from my credit card by Apple. I don't have any Apple products or services and no accessible accounts so couldn't understand the charge.The only thing I can think is that I signed up for EE Broadband and Mobile some time ago. EE completely messed up so I cancelled under the 14 day cooling of period. Part of the EE offer was free Apple TV or Music (I can't remember which) for X number of months. I took advantage of this offer for maybe two days, until I cancelled the EE services. Upon cancelling the EE services I also lost access to the Apple TV or Music. I am assuming that Apple mistakenly thought I was still on a free trial that has now expired and that this was a valid charge??After losing access I never gave it another thought until the charge occurred on my credit card.After the charge occurred, I found the only valid Apple account I had was one where my phone number was the username. Every time I tried to log in with that username, Apple wanted me to change the username to an email address and every time I entered one Apple said ""an error has occurred and wouldn't let me go any further. But I could see, but couldn't change or access, that that account had access to my credit card (I could see the last four digits). There was nothing else I could do - I couldn't log-in and therefore I couldn't see any orders or charges and I couldn't cancel or change anything.I'd had no prior notification of the charges and as far as I could ascertain this was daylight robbery - someone had taken my money without my permission. A blatant THIEF and it was APPLE.I contacted Apple by chat and explained everything. I thought it went well and I was understood. However, next I receive an email from Apple saying I understand you have an issue with iTunes! iTunes was never discussed  on chat and it was here that I thought this was going to end badly. Despite what was explained on chat, about the account username, they even requested the following:• The exact issue description and relevant order numbers (if applicable)• Your valid Apple ID email addressNeither of which I could supply.I replied to this email, attaching a transcript of the chat, and I have heard nothing back. I have since replied for a second time asking what is happening and I have still heard nothing. It seems I am being ignored on purpose.Apple, illegally, stole £6.99 off me and I want it back. I also want confirmation that they won't be trying to charge me anymore and that they have closed down all my inaccessible accounts. I don't have any need for their products and services and after this is resolved, I don't want anything to do with them ever again.I have had to cancel my credit card over this and have had to lodge a complaint with my CC provider over this unauthorised transaction as Apple have not assisted at all.I have upset my managers at work over this by refusing to use the £800 iPad Pro they have just given me and five other colleagues for a project. All six iPads are now being returned and being replaced with Samsung tablets. This has given me immense satisfaction because it is now reached a corporate level, even if I never get my £6.99 back.I partly blame EE for this mess won't ever use EE or Apple ever again.

Each time I went through the story, was put on hold, and was cut off.  Twice I was told they would call me back if we were cut off.  No one ever called back and I will have to drive 2 hours to the nearest Apple store to return it!

"Worst company I have ever dealt withWorst company I have ever dealt with.I have only one product with apple and it's apple music, I pay a monthly subscription of £10.99 and have built up a play list for many years.This month apple decided to deactivate my apple ID for no reason. I contacted them to reactivate it for which they put requests in but was denied. They have given no explanation as to why it's been deactivated and have told me they could not reactivate it. I asked for this to be escalated and then spoke to a manager. The manager said he could not help my any further it's been deactivated and they could not retrieve any of my music, so years or downloading music has now gone.I then asked for some reason and explanation for which he could not give me, I asked to escalate it and he said I was speaking to a manager and he has noted this as a complaint but he cannot guarantee I will get any response to my complaint, to which I said that's not good enough, to which he said you can send a written complaint and I asked will I get a response, he said I cannot guarantee you will get a response. There is no accountability and no way to escalate any complaint. It's honestly shocking. I will never buy a product of apples again and warn anyone who has apple music to consider switching to someone else incase this happens to you. Oh and to really rub the salt in the wounds, yesterday I was charged £10.99 for my subscription that they cannot give me or give any reason why they can't give it me.I also asked to SAR for the call with the manager for which he said he will send me but not had any email from him to dateDate of experience:August 04, 2023",31,Joe,1,United Kingdom,2023-08-04 00:00:00.000000,monthly many id good send escalate incase rub give send,Negative

"Apple Support Community removes users articleMy iPhone had undergone Diagnostics tests with a battery health at 89% but I was experiencing major battery loss within hours and phone shutdowns at night. The Apple consultant said I could mail the phone in for repairs but it would cost $756. I asked her how do you know how to charge if you don’t know what’s wrong with the phone? I also had the battery replaced and paid $159. The phone continued to drain to the point that after 3 hours the phone would shutdown at night time it had to be left plugged in. On numerous occasions I told the Apple customer service people I suspected the IOS updates 16.4 to have done something to the phones battery. Apple-vehemently denied this. I also discovered friends, family and strangers to be suffering the same with their phones. In some cases people bought new phones. Last week there was an update 16.6 incredibly like a miracle my battery issue’s disappeared overnight. Was Apple testing me and others our patience to see if we would pay for a $756 repair or buy a new $1399 iPhone in the belief that our iPhones life was over. You be the judge to me this is coercion. As it is I have lost time and aggravation and $159 for nothing.What’s worse is that when I posted a warning to other users on Apple Support Community my post was removed. I have taken my case up with consumer affairs and encourage others to do the same.Date of experience:August 03, 2023",6,Steve,1,Australia,2023-08-03 00:00:00.000000,major wrong drain numerous new last update new,Positive

Apple had called me to let me know that the package was opened and empty when it arrived back to their depot. I advised Apple that the package was sealed and contained the airpods when handed in at the drop off point. If the package would have been opened then the person at the drop of point would not have accepted the package and would have given me it back. So for this reason, there is evidence that the package was sealed and even CCTV in the store. Apple advised that they needed to investigate and would let me know within 48 hours and not to worry.It was much later than 48 hours and they told me they would not be refunding me.

"They are practicing deceitful…They are practicing deceitful practices. Promoting student pricing STARTING at a price and offering $100 gift card but then you pay for the hundred dollar gift card at $100. Item is the iPad Air for students: This in turns put you back at the original promotion of the student starting pricing. Example $549 student pricing minus special offer of $100 off. This leaves you at $449, it then adds on $100 for the gift card totaling $549. The website shows without the student option for the product of $599 so in actuality you are not receiving $100 discount. The total of 549+ the taxes of approximately $47 totals the original amount without the student discount for this product, also the deceitful part that is shown shows that it says the price is starting which means it is at a minimum of 549.

I said preferably by GBP but I reiterated again that this card is for use in NZ so whatever the process is I am happy to pay.He then said he has to direct me to the gift card department, agreed, waited another 15-20 minutes to speak to this extremely impatient and rude lady who even before I could explain my request, started commenting she cannot help as it is a UK gift card. What the hell? I clearly mentioned I do not have a gift card, I want to buy one which can be used in NZ. She just said ‘I am telling you, you can’t’ and continues to interrupt me when I am trying to explain. After waiting for so long, anyone would get frustrated and my tone was definitely above being patient but there was no alternative offered.When I asked her if there is an option of going to apple.nz and if she can help me with that, she just bluntly said ‘they won’t accept your card’I just had to hang up because she left no opportunity for me to communicate with her.Dear Apple, all I wanted was to purchase a gift card to send to my sister in NZ.Very very disappointing.Date of experience:July 22, 2023",1,Meghalie Borah,1,United Kingdom,2023-07-22 00:00:00.000000,new right happy direct impatient lady interrupt long tone patient alternative accept,Positive

I dropped and went back to apple. And kudos to them right, because it’s way better.Haven’t had a problem.

You have accurately found my iPad, my iMac, and my Roku, but now AirPods.When I completely login to iCloud, Apple has my iPods located at the last airport I flew into, Philadelphia, and I start a panic.An hour and a half later, I found my AirPods in the bottom of my computer bag, or I keep my MacBook Pro.

"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLEABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! iPhone was stolen in June so I figured I’ll just use the find my iPhone feature right? WRONG! I had forgotten my Apple ID password and found out you can’t even use the feature unless you can sign into the account. Ok..fine..I’ll just reset the password right? WRONG!! After several attempts to even contact some kind of support I was told I would have to wait until July to reset the password. Considering I use my phone for work I couldn’t wait that long to be able to use the “find my iPhone “ feature..so ended up having to spend out money for a replacement phone. Got the replacement and still had to wait until I was able to reset password..reset the password..wrote it down..tried to sign in apple account and it still wouldn’t work. Contact support again so they could fix the issue right? WRONG AGAIN! Even after explaining the password had already been reset once Apple still made me go through the entire process all over again. Now I’m missing work and money because I can’t even sign into my iCloud for information needed for work. Then they schedule a call with a advisor..maybe they can help right? WRONG AGAIN! After speaking to 2 of them nothing was resolved and nothing has been done to fix the issue. They only tell me I will have to wait days AGAIN just to receive a email telling me a separate day I will have to wait too in order to reset the password. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!

He said it depends on how much it cost them to repair it. I then told him I believe they had to return my shuttered phone but he gave me a lame excuse again.

The apple is nothing more than a scam machine, a machine that costs more than a thousand dollars just to fry eggs because of its poor heat. The keyboard is very bad, appearing for a long time, many people complain but it can't be repaired. The higher the ios version, the more bugs, it must be born only to sell more new devices by making the old iphone worse. The current company and its CEO are simply money... money.... money. but it doesn't have any significant improvements like when steven jobs .

The machine is so hot that it bothers me to hold it in my hand, the technology released is just outdated. If the company feels self-respecting, it shouldn't sell phones anymore, before the company can do the simplest things with consumer demand.

"Apple doesn't care about quality or the customerI had such a bad experience today at the Apple Store in the Galleria, and feel so hurt, disrespected, and misled by the way I've been treated over a period of time, by multiple Apple employees -- most recently Nick Ehrman, the Genius Bar supervisor at the Apple Store in the St. Louis Galleria -- that I feel compelled to share my experience with others and discourage them from buying Apple products, unless they too want to be left with devices that are broken by design and that Apple refuses to stand behind and fix.I have a 2016 MacBook Pro. I learned only in 2020 (not from Apple contacting me upfront, but from being contacted by an attorney associated with a class action settlement) that my computer was covered under the terms of a repair program to address a design flaw with the ""butterfly keyboard"" that caused keys to become stuck and/or unresponsive (Apple has since discontinued the butterfly keyboard for this reason). I then called Apple Support, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, and confirmed that my computer's serial number was among those covered. I requested a mail in repair, but was told that I needed to bring it into the store because the repair was not eligible for shipping. I said I was not willing to take it to the store at the risk of my health (this was still pre-vaccine, when nearly everyone was doing their best to stay inside), and so I offered to pay the cost of shipping. I was told I still could not do this, and needed to take it into the store. This made me feel like Apple was adopting a tactic to reduce the likelihood of people actually getting their repair done -- and therefore, to reduce Apple's costs -- which bothered me and reduced my trust in Apple. However, I was told on that same phone call that because my device was covered, I was covered in perpetuity and could bring my device in for repair in the future whenever I felt comfortable doing so. So I accepted the situation, and decided to wait until the Covid emergency was declared over to bring it in again.Fast forward to today, June 27, 2023, less than two months after the federal government declared an end to the pandemic emergency (May 5). I took my computer to the Apple Store in St. Louis Galleria to get the faulty keyboard fixed, and after hearing my problem, the ""genius"" pulled up an Apple website and told that me the program had ended and that my computer could no longer be fixed. I explained the circumstances above -- that I had been promised a fix at whatever point I felt comfortable, and that the problem itself was the result of acknowledged faulty design by Apple -- and asked that an exception be made to cover the repair. They told me at the Apple Store that they could not (Genius bar manager) and would not (store manager) make an exception, and told me Customer Support could. I called Customer Support this evening, spoke to a senior advisor, explained the situation, and he, too, told me that not only could he not make an exception, he could not refer me to anyone who could, and that the repair would not be covered under any circumstances.I have been buying Apple products only for nearly 25 years. When I got married, I started buying them for my wife. When I had a child, I started buying them for my daughter. Over this time, I have seen the quality of Apple products decline and its ""it just works"" software become less functional and intuitive, but I have stuck with Apple because of brand loyalty and because Apple has generally fixed problems in good faith when something went wrong. In this case, that good faith has disappeared and been replaced by what I consider cynical bad faith, with several levels of Apple employees providing wrong information and refusing (or being unable) to take accountability and initiative for a product that was flawed upon purchase, and which the company had already committed to fix at my convenience.The bottom line is that I'm stuck with a broken computer that was doomed to fail when I first took it out of the box. If this sounds fair to you, by all means buy Apple, as I have for a quarter century. If not, join me in buying elsewhere, as I plan to do from here on out.Date of experience:June 27, 2023",2,Michael Deuser,1,United States,2023-06-28 00:00:00.000000,bad misled multiple nick want broken repair become stuck unresponsive serial covered bring eligible willing tactic reduced covered future comfortable accepted bring federal end pandemic faulty comfortable senior married functional intuitive good wrong good cynical bad faith several wrong unable take initiative fix bottom broken first fair plan,Negative

I bought a $900 phone, and I was lying for $20.00? wow!! Thanks, Apple, for treating your customer this way. The staff/supervisor are rude and unhelpful. Apple itself is a sleazy company when it comes to pricing. They were showing $799.00 for 128 GB iPhone 14; in the fine print it says this price was for Verizon customers.

"High tech product = security?We spend money pursuing high tech product for more security, but it ended up bring ourselves into a net controlled by somebody.  Everything you do within a phone and Mac, is easy to be tracked and monitored. Once you are in a special situation, those information may become something will make your life in trouble and even in physical risk. They can locate you or can know where you are going exactly.  Before you even arrive there, the criminal have been already send their people there waiting for you with a prepared poison meal on the half way of your trip.  The technology has aimed the criminal to power up in this era.One year ago, you could see heat-up phone and fast draining battery when the cyber criminal performed their task inside your phone. But this year, they can permanently reside in your Apple product without any trail left in Activity Monitor even though they come up to do attack in a special moment. No matter how many times you do device erasing and keep eyes on Activities Monitor, no downloading, no anything that will cause malware, but the hacker are still there and are not removable.The gray out button of Clear History in Safari has brought great convenient for them to track your activities and monitor you 24 hrs & 360 days, even work harder than yourself.  The software update function behaves like a struggle child, its update time only last for seconds and it tells you it has done the job during the key moment you are fighting with cyber criminals. It is sloppy job, no one knows if it is actually finished or it is simply a lie!For a certain period, My Mac behaved like it was controlled by an invisible hand after Apple suggested turning on Rapid Security Respond. I researched online, it was actually a new feature of Mac. But one person said it was a malware. I finally prefer trusting Apple website and turned on the button. It ended up the hackers were still as active as usual, but adding my Mac another side effect which is the page and curser will be jumping around and the window will close by itself, the exported files would rapidly fly and then disappear by itself.So, I am pretty confused with what part was done by hacker and what part was the genuine system.

"Most Greedy and Disrespectful Business I have ever seen!!After purchasing a phone for my daughter last year within a short month it started giving me problems. I took it back to the site where I purchased it and I was told I needed an ESIEM and the physical SIEM was causing the issues. A week after that the phone screen turned green with lines down it then went completely black. I called Apple who lied to me and said they were sending a loaner until it was repaired. I received nothing not even a box to send the phone in. I then called them back to have them make an appointment at the nearest Apple Store which is an hour away and when I left work early to drive all the way there they set the appointment up for a shopping appointment not a repair appointment so I was sent on my way. I called again to set another appointment and this time they found a Best Buy that was 7 minutes from my house. I again left work early to drive there to be told they can’t help me because they phone needs to be sent in and there is a mail in ticket already open as they failed to cancel it. So I was once again sent away. I called back in again to talk about my options to get this phone repaired and they refused to talk to me as my minor daughters iCloud account is in her name. Completely ridiculous as the phone is in my name and I pay for it. We got that resolved and they mailed me a box to send the phone in. They repaired it to send it back for it to have the same issue shortly after. I had to call to send it back in for a second time for the same issue. Within a month it was doing the same thing again. This time when I called in they said if it does the same thing after the third repair I will get a replacement phone. Well they will not fix the phone as they are claiming it now has water damage which is absolutely not true and if it does did not come from my end. The customer service person I talked to after calling in when I received the email claiming this agreed it was very strange they didn’t see water damage the first or second time they opened the phone but rather the third time and it has hit the year mark of owning the phone so there no longer are any warranties etc. They refused to help me and refused to let me talk to a manager and disconnected the call. I then emailed the CEO, CFO AND COO of Apple for neither of them to reach out but someone from their office to reach out. He claimed he was going to investigate this issue and get back to me. I asked him what I should do about the phone as I was unsure what would happen if I didn’t answer them about what to do with the phone. He said there should be a date that I have to answer by which was not specified anywhere on the email that I screenshot for him. He said he extended the time frame so I wouldn’t have to worry until this issue was resolved. A few days later I received an email from them saying they were sending the phone back to me I not repaired. I reached back out explaining my concern and he said he extended it so he was unsure as to why that happened. He then explained I would have an answer by the end of the week as to what the outcome will be. He reached back out two days later and told me they will not be replacing the phone as the technician shown there was water damage and disregarded everything else. When I asked him to speak with someone higher than him as he seemed to not care either he told me I could not speak to anyone else as he was assigned to the case and this is the final result. Apple is the absolute worst and they are very sad people to treat customers the way they do by lying to them, hanging up on them, not resolving any of their issues, as well as not acting if they got ripped off or taken care of. I would never recommend Apple products to anyone and as soon as I can get the money I will be switching all of our laptops, phones etc over to Samsung and taking out business elsewhere that is not so greedy and rude!Date of experience:June 16, 2023",5,Lisa Couch,1,United States,2023-06-16 00:00:00.000000,last short physical green black drive appointment appointment sent open minor ridiculous box call second third true come agreed strange second third investigate extended extended technician final sad greedy,Negative
"Too many ifs and butsThough I like the Apple products, god forbid you forget a password. We were previously advised by Apple that as my elderly mother had forgotten her security questions they would be not be able to unlock her device (even though we had receipts). I asked ‘so we just throw away a 6month old iPad’ and they said ‘sorry nothing we can do.Recently we are trying to unlock my husbands device and even though we passed all the security (which took 24hrs to approve) we now have to wait 72hrs before we can begin to unlock the device. We need it now, and don’t understand why 72 hours are required.They need to understand that people can forget passwords.

"Never Buy Apple Products in IndiaAs an avid user of Apple products, I feel compelled to share my extremely disappointing experience with Apple's service center in India. I strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing any Apple product or Apple Care within the country. The level of service provided is abysmal, to say the least, and it is disheartening to witness the complete lack of accountability, especially when it comes to warranty claims.Let me provide you with an account of my own ordeal. Despite my AirPods Pro being well within the warranty period and experiencing a manufacturing issue, the service center deliberately delayed addressing the problem until the warranty had expired. It has been a relentless battle since April, continuously following up with them, only to be met with empty promises and a complete disregard for proper tracking and skilled technicians. Astonishingly, major cities lack dedicated Apple service centers, and instead, rely on third-party facilities. Even if your product is under warranty, don't expect a replacement, as you would in the US or UK.Adding insult to injury, the treatment received from Apple's service personnel is utterly disrespectful, as if owning a premium product does not warrant attention or respect. It bewilders me that there seems to be a lack of a proper tracking mechanism within Apple's international care system. It appears that no matter the exorbitant amount one may spend on an Apple product in India, even if it requires repairs the very next day or if a manufacturing defect arises, one might as well consider it a lost cause. Offering them a year for service or expecting a replacement is futile.If you happen to be reading this, I implore you to heed my words and refrain from purchasing an Apple product in India. I have personally suffered the consequences of my hard-earned money going to waste. I encourage you to explore various forums on Apple in India, where you will find countless individuals grappling with similar issues regarding Apple's service standards. Unless you manage to escalate your concerns to Apple's international care team, the situation in India is unlikely to change. Protect your finances by avoiding Apple products in the Indian market.Date of experience:June 15, 2023",6,raja ram,1,India,2023-06-15 00:00:00.000000,disappointing urge abysmal disheartening witness complete warranty provide ordeal pro warranty empty complete major expect disrespectful premium warrant proper international exorbitant next various countless similar international unlikely,Negative

"Select Apple Store in Carmarthen should not be your chosen Apple store to visit ! You could be conned !My wife and I have been regular customers of Select (previously Stormfront) Apple store, very satisfied with outstanding service buying new iPhones and iPads. Not anymore.Select - Timeline1.	Tuesday 16th May 23 - placed the order for an iPhone 14 Pro Max in purple with Mitch, in the presence of my wife, taking advantage of the special offer of a £433 in part exchange for my old iPhone Pro Max 256 GB which he examined and satisfied himself very well looked after, no scratches whatsoever. Mitch asked me to check a week before 01st June2.	Tuesday 06th June - Mitch attended to the lengthy paperwork for credit agreement with Klarna - explained to me how he was disappointed with the credit broker changing terms and conditions without good communication: part exchange value reduced to £314 but, offering 0% interest instead. Mitch told me he was offering me £73 as a gesture of goodwill (not seen in the paperwork). It was past closing time. I therefore agreed to come on Thursday 08th about 3.30pm as Mitch was not in on Friday3.	Mitch did not give me any paperwork, which he kept in a hold-all bag underneath the counter, otherwise I would have noticed the big mistake!4.	Thursday 08th - I was in Select by 3.30pm to find Mitch serving another customer, therefore, Scot was asked to serve me. When he took the new iPhone out of the box only I discovered it was not the pro max I ordered. Mitch denied it, saying it was a pro !5.	In hindsight, I wish I stood my ground to insist Mitch re-order the correct model for me and kept my old iPhone pro max till the new one arrived!6.	Scot proceeded to transfer the data to the iPhone 14 pro and I finally left the shop, feeling very upset, again past closing time.7.	After I got back home, I felt deeply disappointed with the feel of the new iPhone given its smaller size and not comfortable with it at all!8.	I have lost my yahoo emails completely and Barclays mobile app on the new iPhone!9.	Friday 09th - I telephoned early morning when Natalie answered. I explained in detail my complete dissatisfaction to be sold a different model to what I ordered. She listened carefully and promised to refer the issues to her line manager, reassuring she would get back to me before closing time on Monday 12th June.10.	Monday -12 June: Natalie telephoned me with shocking news: she was brushing aside the big mistakes made by Mitch placing the wrong order, offering me totally unacceptable terms: losing -15% of the value of the iPhone 14 pro, my having to reapply for another loan agreement with Klarna, credit broker who she said may take a very long time etc.11.	This is no way to treat any customer let alone a 77 year old pensioner!12.	Previous very professional young staff are all gone ! One wonders why?13.	Now they trot out lame excuses like being very short staffed !14.	I am in the process of involving Citizens Advice Bureau in Carmarthen who in turn can involve Trading Standards Officials as fundamental consumer rights have been breached left right and centre in my case !15. Tuesday 04th July: As prearranged by an Executive of Select, I called in at Select in Carmarthen to collect my new iPhone 14 Pro Max without having to pay anything extra as a gesture of goodwill from the Executive.

"Do NOT buy your phone from APPLEI was completely ripped off by an Apple employee!! She was very nice and bubbly all while she was ‘setting me up’! I was getting 3 ‘upgraded’ phones and I saw all these deals for FREE Apple 14 phones. I asked if I should go through my service provider and she ASSURED ME she could offer me the same deal. I asked if we were on a recorded line, several times and I kept asking “Are you sure these will all be for free!!” To which she advised each time, YES and YES!! (Yes, recorded line and yes, phone will be free.) Fast forward…I receive the phones and the necessary return boxes for my phones. New phones set up, old phones sent back in their “provided mailers”. I now wanted a phone case and went to At+t. The guy in the store brings up my account and asks why didn’t I go into the store so that I could have gotten all 3 phones for FREE?! I told him there were supposed to be for free. He said no, Apple gave me a trade-in value only for $200 per phone and I am financing the balance of each phone!! WHAT?!!! I went home and contacted Apple immediately and after going back and forth and over 2 hours on the phone - I got NO WHERE!! I asked for a supervisor and told them to pull the recorded line and I gave him the representative’s name I worked with, even the email address she gave me to use in the future, because I told her I would be getting a 4th phone, for my husband in the near future. Supposedly they reviewed the recording, but there was nothing they could do for me! I told them I wanted my old phones back and I would cancel this order and go into At+t and deal with them directly. I was then told they ‘destroy’ the phones once received and there was no way they could do that. Bottom line…DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE from APPLE directly…go through your provider. APPLE sucks and so does their customer service!! BUYER BEWARE!And if you have to contact them, hang up FAST if you get a person namedMS COOPER.

"Absolute terrible customers serviceAbsolute terrible customers service. I lost the charging case for my Airpods Pro 2 yesterday. Alternatively I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2 in the charging case of my older Airpods Pro 1. That didn't work. So I went to the Apple store in Amsterdam today to buy a new charging case for my Airpods Pro 2. They needed the serial number. But after checking my bluetooth connection on my phone for the Airpods Pro 2, the customer support employees discovered that this was the exact same serial number as from my Airpods Pro 1. The fact that I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2, in the charging case of my Airpods Pro 1, automatically changed the serial number of the Airpods Pro 2 on my iPhone, to the serial number of the Airpods Pro 1. The customer support insisted that they needed the serial number before I could buy a new charging case. But there was no way for them to find that serial number. I called with Bol.com, where I bought the Airpods 2. They also could not tell me what the serial number is. I have the original receipt from Bol.com, but that also does not mention the serial number. The 2 serial numbers from the Left and Right Airpods Pro 2 itself, were still visible on my iPhone. But the customer support said they could not use those serial numbers to find the serial number from charging box, because the charging box has a separate serial number. So I asked them how are we going to resolve this. I need a new charging case, otherwise I cannot use my Airpods Pro 2, and I need them for work next week. They refused to sell me a charging case. They kept repeating that they need that serial number. The serial number I don't have. Because Apple changes the serial number on my iPhone if I put the Airpods in another charging case. How was I suppose to know that. Half of the employees of the 'Genius Bar' did not know that. Then the manager tried to put the blame in my shoes, that I would been better if I made the purchase with them directly, and not with Bol.com (one of the biggest retailers in NL) + that I should not have put the Airpods Pro 2 in the Airpods Pro 1 charging case. Even half of their Genius Bar support staff was unaware of this fact. How was I suppose to know this, they look exactly the same! I said that I wanted to hear a solution from them. That just saying we cannot help you is not a solution. They offered me a minor discount on a new set of Airpods, which costs ~300 euro. Instead of a new charging case, which cost 120 euro. Totally unacceptable. It is the extreme arrogance and complete unwillingness to find a suitable solution for a customer that really sticks. They think they can be really arrogant and give dreadful service because they have a monopoly. I just looked Apple up here on Truspilot, to see what other people's experiences are with Apple. They get a 1-star rating from 70% of reviews; +5.000 1-star reviews in total. No reactions from Apples staff on the complaints there. They don't see the need. That says it all I think.

"Horrible customer serviceMy 80 year old neighbor’s phone became in active. The touchscreen wasn’t working at all and while I was trying to troubleshoot it went black.It’s his only lifeline. We went into the Apple Store hoping for an appointment for the evening. They flat out refused, the manager insisted we wait a whole other 24 hours before his phone was even looked at.This is an absolute safety issue. An 80-year-old man alone in his home without access to any communication! This is ridiculous. He should have been moved to the front of the line because of the level of urgency.I sincerely hope nothing happens to him during the night.Now I have to again bring him to the store, which is 20 minutes away.

"APPLE and UPS - how to big companies bullied and allowed thief to steal from the consumer?#racist #asianhate #stealing #neverreceivedorderAPPLE and UPS - how the two big companies bullied and allowed thief to steal from the consumer?We recently bought an Iphone 14 pro max 1TB from Apple and they gave us options to have it home delivered. We normally buy all the products in-store and this is the first time we tried home delivery. It will be the last to deal with Apple ever again.Apple used UPS for delivery my phone which I paid for in full - total of $1800.00 - but I've never receive the phone. I suspect the UPS delivery woman stole my phone because she parked in front of our house for a while then rushed the box to my dad and left in a hurry. On the UPS tracking website it said that signature required but she never asked for signature and we did not sign anything. 15 mins later, we open the box and found out it is an empty box (which was not completely sealed, there was no tape on both sides of the box), nothing in there. We contacted both Apple and UPS but both parties kept kicking the ball and no one take the case into serious investigation. Apple refused to refund me the money. Both parties caused me so much stress and anxiety without doing anything to protect their consumer.I lost $1800.00 and left with fury. I shared the story on Facebook page of my neighborhood. My neighbor said they lost their MacBook the same way but they got refunded.

"You have to buy a new product to regain access to your account if you lose the security question info.I realized it had been a while since I logged into my Apple account. I really only have ever used it for iTunes, I had an iPod for many years and only stopped using it when it could no longer download apps, but I was thinking about looking at their phones since some of my family have them and like them. My account was locked, which was easily remedied. But then I was locked out because I can't remember the security questions I created for this account when I was 15... 15 years ago. I tried the ""reset the security questions"" link & was brought to a page that said  ""Cannot Reset Security Questions We don’t have sufficient information to reset your security questions.""I contacted support, & was told that I needed a new apple device to gain control of an account I made *without* an apple device. Absolutely absurd. When I told her I couldn't & wouldn't go to a store for this, she told me to go back to the iforgot.apple site, which didn't work in the first place & is why I needed help.It's really messed up when you have to buy a new product to gain access to an account that has your sensitive information on it. I told customer service I had access to all the info I've ever used on the account: billing address, full credit card info, name, birthday, purchase history, and that I can probably guess 2/3 of the security questions, that I just suspected that there was a typo. But she just told me to go to an Apple store. How about no? She also suggested I make a new account, but my old account has my sensitive information on it, and I'd prefer to use that!Not doing business with Apple ever again, because this is such a scummy, slimy tactic.

"I am giving you 1 star because I cannot…I am giving you 1 star because I cannot give you 0. What a nightmare! There is a chaos with the apple account that nobody seems to be able to solve. I have already spoken with two customer assistants for HOURS on the phone, I am talking to a manager, Ilay, however you write it, right now but he apparently can't solve the problem either. The original problem was that I keep on getting this pop up saying that I have a virus. More than two hours afterwards, we had to change both the passwords of my laptop and Apple ID. We managed to change the one for my laptop but my Apple ID was unsuccessful. And then is when the true nightmare began.I went to the shop directly and spoke to the ""Genius"" technician. At some point I know that he changed some password somewhere, I don't know where or why, but he put apple just as the password somewhere, and he left it at that. I WASTED all Sunday in the shop, but I couldn't stay there for so long, oh no. Apple doesn't want frustrated and unhappy customers in the shop-they might put off other customers. Of course not, even when they are being absolutely incompetent at problems they created. So I had to spend one hour waiting in the mall doing nothing until I could come back so that the guy tried to recover the password once again. By the way, while this Genius guy was at it, he changed all the settings: no alarms for some reason, the light on my screen turned off for some reason, so I had to call AGAIN so that another person helped me to put everything right again.Anyway, it didn't work again, so I had to wait almost a month to get a six digit thing sent to my phone and recover my apple account.Did it work today? Oh, no. Of course not. So I called again customer services. Somebody called Ilay who said he was a manager was giving me instructions, but half the time I didn't even know what password he was talking about, what he was describing. The guy looked bored as hell, but I was not bored, I was angry and upset.In the end he was no help at all and clueless. He is puzzled why the system keeps on asking me for a password of a different computer that I never had. So I cannot have any updates, so my personal and banking data is going to be at risk more and more. This is my first computer and I can tell you right now that is going to be the last.In the end, according to this guy, it's all my fault, because I don't know all my previous passwords. Who is going to remember old, changed passwords? What am I supposed to remember those? When you change passwords, the old ones get invalidated. But not with Apple, and somehow this is all my fault, according to Manager Ilya that has not helped at all.But not with Apple. They wanted me to remember old passwords to see if one of them works.

"Apple are disgraceI have reverted to Apple technologies in the past 5 years from Microsoft - IBM. I own an iMac 2019 Intel desktop, iPhone 14 Pro max, iPad 11"" Pro, M2 Pro Mac Mini, and a series 7 Apple watch, and a heap of accessories all of which are Apple branded. The iPhone and the iPad are about the best of the eco system. I wanted to award Apple only one star but admittedly some of their products are quite good. My focus of this review is more to do with the iMac 2019 and the Mac Mini. The 2019 intel iMac came with host of unforeseen issues, I bought this computer because I am disabled / diabetic etc, and the university recommended an Apple computer as it would come preloaded with software to assist me in completing a Masters degree. The software on the desktop did not work and to get it to work like it should have, there were additional steps that neither me or the tutor who came to my home were aware of, it was an added layer of a learning curve to which I did not need at a time when I required a computer that was supposedly easy to use. After I had completed my second degree successfully, the search for employment began, as you would expect, in the time that I have had the iMac desktop I have lost 4 job opportunities, this is due to the way MS Teams that for some unknown reason locks into a weird loop when there is an attempt to use it, when you speak to Apple Tech support they tell you that due to MS Teams being a third party software that it has nothing to do with them, it is like Apple is not designed to run third party softwares which everyone knows that is complete and utter rubbish, the real reason for them not assisting is because they do not know about their own product well enough to advise accordingly. The iMac desktop issues did not end there, saving MS Word documents became an ordeal as well, because for some reason, the amendments would not save and when they did the entire document was lost somewhere in a file. So iMac desktop is garbage, and the tech support is not much better, they will fob you at a drop of a hat, to get out of doing a job they are paid for! Then we come to the Mac Mini which was an infuriating buys experience - this is surrounding the compatibility of displays, mainly their own 2019 iMac desktop display. Apple has removed the Target Display Mode from before 2014 so the iMac 2019 cannot be used a display for the Mac Mini, this is a fact, and it was something that was constantly contradicted between tech support at Apple and, Apple's own website, no one knew, no one knows, I had to dig up YouTube videos where other buys of this device confirmed that the Mac mini 2023 cannot be used with a 2019 Apple display, ironically, the Mac mini will work with any other display brand ... like Samsung?????? And it will definitely work along side the 1600 quid Mac Studio display, and it will work with any Mac desktop from BEFORE 2014. By then I had already bought and paid for this device, I am going on for teacher training early next year and I need an updated computer that will serve my current eco system so it was an arm twist in having to buy this device. The thing with Apple is that their claims on their own products are stated in half sentences or omitted completely, this serves as misleading and contemptible. If you buy a desktop with Apple make sure you do all of the back ground research before opting to pay for it. I have yet to feel delight, joy and satisfaction with an Apple product without having to buy this, that and the other for it to get proper functionality out of the device. When compared to Android, Microsoft - Apple's only advantage is in its security features and built in privacy, but then as a consumer you should expect this due to Apple Pay. I have taken Apple to the ASA over what I truly believe to be a misleading sale on the Mac mini computer. There was one problem with the iPhone 12 Pro Max that I owned a last year before upgrading, the screen display for some peculiar reason magnified, the phone became inoperable as a result, in an attempt to get the handset back to normal the phone automatically called the Police three times, in the end the local constabulary contacted me to issue a formal warning that if I attempted any further hoax calls I would be subject to a prosecution! Jony Ives says using iPhone is ""intuitive"" that is his way of saying that it is common sense - I can tell you there was nothing intuitive about having to revive a screen on a phone that had by itself enlarged the display, for what reason would you require this feature on a handset? I had to use three fingers, then tap, and the screen would restore itself- not exactly intuitive if you didnt know. I find Jony Ives word insulting and compounds my feelings of raging hate towards Apple fully justified.Date of experience:June 27, 2022",30,James Chang,2,United Kingdom,2023-05-27 00:00:00.000000,past pro good unforeseen diabetic assist additional aware easy second search due unknown tech due third third complete rubbish real entire file fob mac tech mac side early next current device contemptible sure delight buy proper due last peculiar inoperable normal local constabulary formal intuitive common intuitive intuitive hate,Positive

Can do anything a person would need any device for and can do it with relative ease, especially the newer models as chips get better and better. Older devices tend to slow down and lose their effectiveness yet I find that this is less the case with the newer generation devices that come out since the quality of the device just improves overall. For other devices than the iPhone they work just the same degradation-wise, they are all pricey yet effective.

"Chinese Tim been a disaster for AppleI purchased an iPhone 14 Pro on the 4th of May (23). I soon discovered that it auto-locks in 75 seconds, regardless of the setting. There was also a problem with the screen not being responsive in all areas. I called Apple twice, used their live chat, and finally took the phone to their ""Genius Bar"" on day 8 of the purchase, their ""expert"" reset the phone and said she timed it, and it works- a complete trickster that I shouldn't have trusted! On returning home, I discovered the phone was exactly as before going to Apple. Called Apple on day 10, and they agreed to send a replacement. The process of sending the phone back and getting a replacement was a stressful week because of the subcontractors Apple are using: Collecting the phone, nowhere on the paperwork said it was Apple, and all the printed references were theirs. Even the tracking number was for delivery of the label and not for tracking the phone back to them. They only acknowledged they received the phone after I managed to contact them and complain. On the 19th of May, Apple was telling me they had processed my order, and the replacement would be with me on 16 May (three days before!)After all that time wasted for both Apple and me and the cost that Apple incurred, the new phone is defective, exactly as the first was!As I see it, Apple products are made glossy outside, but it's Chinese crap inside.

I don't understand how a big company like apple can even afford this. I find it inadequate to us clients and almost unacceptable, I must say that getting an iphone without insurance, which costs a mountain to buy too, makes no sense. You never know what can happen to you and you will be without a cellphone for your monthly wage.  I would like to hear some statement and maybe some explanation or help me in finding my ip... The theft is reported to the Police, only they can't do much about such a theft.

"Faulty i phone 11.The cellular aerial failed in my i phone after 2 years 4 months. It was bought from John Lewis and I approached them as the retailer and they asked me to get me a report from apple. The apple genius bar report stated ""phone not providing any cellular service-diagnostics run on the device and flagged internal cellular Rf failure. No issues found with regards to physical damage/liquid damage or customer misuse. Advised due to internal issues the phone should be replaced.John Lewis' response was as follows;With regards to your main concern, that being your claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 over your Apple iPhone 11, I have reviewed your case and consulted with the team responsible for assessing customer claims. Regrettably, I must inform you that they have advised that we reject your claim at this time. The reason for this is that the Genius Bar report does confirm that there is a fault currently with the device, but there is no mention that the fault is inherent with the device or components wherein. Therefore you do not have a valid claim in this circumstance. They are refusing to budge on this stance.I called the apple store again who advised that this scenario is not unusual with John Lewis and they advised me to contact Apple support as the manufacturer of the device to see if they would honour the device under the consumer rights act 2015. They refused to do so stating that the retailer is responsible.I am now in possession of a supposedly high quality device that cost me £725 two and a half years ago that is not economically worth repairing [the device is sealed and `Apple quoted £475 for the repair]. Both the retailer and the manufacturer are refusing to recognise the device should be replaced due to an inherent fault despite the apple store effectively acknowledging that this is in fact the case.Apple are even refusing to offer anything for the phone in part exchange for a new oneAs a loyal apple user for over 20 years I find this extremely disappointing and I feel very let down by a company that my family and I have been fans of for many years.If apple use third party retailers to market their good they should ensure that they are reputable and will comply with the Consumer rights act of 2015.

"Apple Watch UltraRecently purchased the Apple Watch Ultra, and although it is definitely a step-up on the Series 7, the fitness tracking is still too unreliable.Despite doing a number of runs both outdoors and indoors, the watch is always way behind on tracked distance. As an example, I have just finished a 10km run on a treadmill, yet the watch has tracked it as 8.12km. Apple suggests running outdoors so that the watch can re-calibrate. Have done this a number of times and still no luck. A simple solution would be to give you the option to alter the tracked distance, much like other companies like Garmin allow. Really don’t understand why Apple have never released such a simple solution.If you’re after a fitness watch, I’d strongly recommend Polar or Garmin.

"Don’t buy anything from apple India…Don’t buy anything from apple India online, such a rip off. I placed a bulk order online and I mixed up a product and needed an exchange. Every country has a 14-30 day exchange or refund policy. However, apple India does not. I think consumers should have rights with a mistake they can make online. & I am not even asking for refund. 14-30 day refund or exchange policy is to make people shift to online if they happen to mix up with their online orders. It’s called CONSUMER RIGHTS. That’s why people like going to to stores and buying where they can’t mix up.We pay so high price for the apple products to get a superior service. Amazon india eBay all have a refund policy.So disappointed with the service and no wonder apple sales are going down.

"Great products that are killed by software updatesI love Apple products and have had an ipad and an iphone for some time now. What i cannot stand about Apple products though is that perfectly good products are killed off by software updates. It doesn't matter if you personally look after your product and keep it in perfect condition because software updates will come along and destroy older products.My current iphone is currently being affected by what I have been told are Battery Bugs. The phones battery percentage goes up and down all over the show and then switches itself off for no reason. This is infuriating for someone who has spent a lot of money on Apple products, believing that if I looked after the product then it would last me a long time, apparently not, it lasts as long as Apple want it to, then it is killed off with updates.My iphone is more than just a phone to me because it monitors my blood sugars via a Dexcom One blood sugars monitoring device that i wear. I need my iphone to keep track of what is happening to my blood sugars and then suddenly a good battery percentage reduces to 1% and the phone then shuts itself off leaving me not knowing what is going on inside my body.It personally feels like they kill off old products on purpose with these updates to force you to update your product and spend more money with them.For a company that is so big, you would expect better.Date of experience:April 28, 2023",31,Craig Herring,1,United Kingdom,2023-04-28 00:00:00.000000,great good perfect destroy current told last long need good old purpose update big,Positive

"Incompetence and disregard for customersApple sent my less than 6 month old MacBook Pro M1 Max custom-build (£3k cost) for repair.On its return it was lost by UPS.Now it's been 8 days and Apple has done nothing to replace the product as they are waiting on a UPS investigation (even though UPS has confirmed 7 days ago what happened and 5 days ago that the investigation is complete and it was delivered to an Access Point who in turn handed my MacBook to someone else).Apple advised me at the start of this that if this is the case (that the MacBook is lost) that they will provide a new one.Apple however has no interest in getting it done, and every time they call they say no update, and I need it for work.I have had it confirmed to me three times over the last 8 days by UPS. I have given this information (provided to me in writing from UPS) to Apple. I have given Apple the contact details of the UPS Security Department. I have been told by Apple that they would contact the security officer at UPS to verify the information I gave them. They haven't (confirmed to me by both UPS and then, on questioning, Apple).So they lie, and then refuse to their job. Meanwhile I have had no ability to work and am sick and tired of dealing with this level of incompetence and ineptitude.It is not what I expect of a company to whom I fork out a massive amount of money.

"No financing in the shop & delivery takes a month!As a fan of Apple products, I finally made the decision to buy an Apple watch. I saw that the financing option was available and since I have successfully used it in the past, I went into the shop to buy my new watch with financing. The lovely customer assistant informed me that you cannot buy a watch in the shop with financing, but she offered to do it on one of the available laptops. Unfortunately, it didn't work (some problem with the internet or sth) and she advised to do it at home.I went home and had to cancel the first order attempt and redo it, as you cannot pick up where you left off. I did so successfully and had the financing approved in seconds. A day later Apple says that the order is being processed with an estimated delivery date a month later! After contacting the online customer care they explained that they couldn't do anything to expedite the order, although they understood my frustration.I can understand a delivery date of up to a week, but a month?! This is ridiculous, especially considering that there is no clear information about the length of delivery when you choose financing! If I wanted to cancel and just go and buy it in the shop in cash, I would have to talk to the financing partner and Apple separately of course, which take a long time too.This review doesn't reflect the experience I've had from the face-to-face and online customer service, as they have been excellent despite having their hands tied up by the idiotic Apple policies.Date of experience:April 25, 2023",4,Valia,1,United Kingdom,2023-04-25 00:00:00.000000,available past new available expedite understood understand ridiculous clear long excellent idiotic,Positive

However, it did have facial recognition. Ok, something new. Well, 3 weeks after purchase the phone no longer recognizes my face. Then it asked for a Passcode. Passcode? Didn’t know there was one. No problem except the phone doesn’t have any means to bypass this feature. When I call customer service they say “Sorry, you’ll just have to erase all the data from your phone” I’m sorry, what?

"Long time loyal Apple  customer now saying...Something very wrong with Apple and specifically the staff at Apple Chadstone Victoria.I've been struggling with a sticky H key on my 2017 Apple MacBook Pro. At first, the issue was sporadic, but it quickly escalated to a point where it became unbearable. After researching online, I discovered that this was a widespread issue affecting all models featuring the 'new butterfly type keyboard' introduced in 2015. This keyboard has caused a lot of problems, especially regarding the issue I encountered. A quick search online reveals endless complaints, and it's gotten so bad that Apple has officially acknowledged the problem and created a fix, in addition to settling a $50 million dollar class action claim for the very same issue.When I went to the Apple Genius Bar at Chadstone, I met with Dave, who visually and physically examined my MacBook Pro and suggested that the issue was  probably some dirt stuck under the key. But after five minutes, Dave returned with a wry smile and told me that the key was broken. He quickly added that it would be too expensive to fix at AUD$1000 and it wasn't worth it. The key was no longer stuck, but it was broken. I confronted Dave, and he said that all he did was blow compressed air under the key.I spoke to the store manager and asked him to review the CCTV footage of our interactions. After seeing it, he agreed with everything I claimed. But, he maintained that all Dave did was wipe the keyboard with a cloth and blow compressed air. I asked the manager if he agreed that the H key looked damaged and broken, sitting lower than any other key on the keyboard, and he said it did. So, I asked why Dave didn't identify it during the initial inspection. The manager then offered to split the damage bill 50/50, but I declined and reported the issue to Apple directly the next day.Apple Australia responded, but their response was disappointing. They sided with the Apple Store staff regarding this matter. It's frustrating to encounter such a widespread known issue, and even more disappointing to receive such an unsatisfactory response from Apple Genius Chadstone, refusing to take responsibility for making my initial well publicised butterfly keyboard fault claim  null and void by completely breaking the keyboard and leaving me in the hole with at least a $500 repair bill which they kindly accepted a partial responsibility for their negligence.

"Don't waste your moneySent my iPhone off for a battery repair last year.

This damage doesn't exist - the phone hasn't ever left the case. It's immaculate.£400 is the price of a new low-end iPhone.This is compounded by the anti right to repair practices by Apple, basically making it impractical or impossible to do the repair myself or get a third party company to fix it. The iOS is designed to throw countless errors at a user if you choose to do this.So the choice is this:- pay the price of a new phone for a battery replacement- buy a new phoneIn this case I bought the cheap SE as it was pointless getting old hardware repaired. But this is an interim solution while I migrate to Android. I won't buy another iPhone after this - even less so a flagship model.Well done Apple.

I was promised by Apple that this new computer would not have all of the issues my 2016  IMac had from the time of purchase. It never worked right and apple tech support was always stumped and could not help me.  Since it was a 27 inch desk top, it was not transportable.  Apple promised me that even though I would be having apple migrate the data from the old computer to the new one, the new one would be flawless and problem free.  I left my old and new computer at the apple store for days while they did the migration of data.  My new computer has had nothing but problems - worse than my 2016 iMac. I have spent hours and hours of draining time consuming phone calls with Apple support.  As soon as they fix (which turns out to be only a temporary fix) one issue, it causes another issue.  Fast forward one year, they now are telling me I have to purchase a backup and wipe the disc clean.  Are they kidding?  Never will I buy a single more apple product.  Nothing but problems. This does not even include the constant incompatibility issues with just about everything to encrypted messages to medical records to veterinary records and now to my brokerage account.  The advice I  get from these sites is that they aren't compatible with Safari to try the chrome or Firefox browser.  The truth no one is compatible with apple and its safari browser. Even my icloud emal doesn't work right.  We stil live in an android world.  I might as well give up the added security of Apple and Safari and get an android which is compatible with everything and much easier to use and that is exactly what I intend on doing.Date of experience:April 15, 2023",1,Susan Friedman,1,United States,2023-04-15 00:00:00.000000,new new right tech top old new new free old new new worse fix temporary single constant medical veterinary compatible safari compatible live android added android compatible,Positive

"2017 touch bar mbp flexgate issue: $600+I’m a buyer of a 2017 touch bar mbp. The computer and system were good, not mind-blowing but good. In late 2022, some clear ligth stripes started to show at the bottom of the screen. Soon you learn they are usually called “stage ligths”. The cause is a well known desing flaw with the screen conector, just google “mbp flexgate problem”. Apple has given some coverture on this problem to buyers of the 2016 version, but none at all to buyers, like me, of the 2017 version. If you own this computer and it suffers from the flexgate problem, with time all the screen will probably go black, as mine did last week. The only solution offered by Apple is to pay them $600+ for the repair. Yes, expensive for a connector… the explanation is elsewhere in the web, again a bad design decission.

"Know fault with product but refused to resolveContacted Support over a known fault with the first generation AirPods Pro which is covered under a recall program. Apple refused repair even after their agent confirmed it should be covered. Experienced poor support direct with Apple support and service to a known problem with AirPods Pro (1sr Gen). Manufacturer fault with product not covered after 3 years of ownership even though a know fault of the batch, in my case very low use of the product so took longer to appear. Senior Manager did not take ownership or provide customer service and responsibility commensurate to level of a premier manufacturer for a long standing customers loyalty.Very disappointed with product quality or durability due to low usage of the item as explained, senior manager had no care or compassion towards the customer which was a polar opposite from the initial agent. This attitude and abruptness demonstrated contempt for the end users and lack of vision to future sales for Apple. I certainly am now thinking the product is not fit for purpose or high value status, if the AirPods  products are not durable for limited use like myself and not supported then no point to utilising Apple products in the future.I would like to state the Senior manager dealing at the end of my call certainly didn’t value customers and would question his capability. It was clear that he wasn’t interested in helping a customer from the moment he took over the call, certainly doesn’t represent and sell the Apple brand I have come to expect over the long years of using the companies multiple products.Great shame Apple doesn’t take commercial responsibility for know faults over technicality points by a petty manager,  perhaps greed is overcoming customer satisfaction and value.

"AirPods Gen 3 Problem with ErgonomicsI am using Apple products since 2000's and I was a fan of Apple products until recent years. Especially after the loss of Steve Jobs, it seems that they became a company who is not focused anymore to user experience as before, but rather a company who is constantly trying to earn more and more without providing in return that much to their Clients. The quality of their products decreased dramatically as well, especially for certain types of products. For example we had to trash 6 AirPods because they became unusable after 2 years. The durability of some of their products are limited almost to the warranty period. After that they deteriorate dramatically or they become unusable. Lastly I purchased or had to purchase a new AirPods Gen 3 due to Apple Ecosystem I am involved in and they are falling out of my ear. Their ergonomics is terrible which was not the case even with 1st gen. Now I don't know what to do with that product. They give you a 15 day trial period, but it is not suitable for everything.

"Overpriced Under-engineered and Built to FailMy MacBookPro 2019 decided to kill itself early one morning. It wasn't under stress. I had a couple of browser tabs open and went for a cup of coffee. When I got back to my desk the screen was black with no indication of what was going on.So I pull out my trusty hundred dollar Raspberry PI (which has been more reliable than any Apple built computer I have ever owned) and start looking into what could have gone wrong.It turns out that many people have had the same issue. Have a look at Louis Rossman’s YouTube Video : “How MOST 16"" Macbook Pros often kill themselves & why they're unfixable”.I contact Apple directly, provide the details of my machine. Which was just out of warranty. I wanted to know if my specific model (A2141)  is on a recall list and if not, why not? I requested that the issue be escalated and I was put through to somebody more senior. Only to be made to feel like the problem is me. Which I took exception to because I know how to look after my equipment.It seems I should have realised that a premium Apple Mac Book Pro requires extra EXTRA special care and if I sneeze in its presence it might die.I am running and have run several other devices within the same environment. Apple is always the problem child when it comes to hardware!Apple then proceeds to tell me that my hardware failure was an isolated incident. We wrapped up the call with her promising to follow up in the next couple of days. I received an email that asked me to provide any additional information I would like to add. So I sent her the link to the video mentioned above.I have had no response to the email and Apple has not called me back as promised.I then take the machine into an Apple Authorised Ripoff Center. Where it is evident that their policy from the start is to replace, no attempt to repair. And because all the components are soldered onto the Logicboard… not only do I have to fork out an obscene amount of money to have it REPLACED, I will also lose my data.Long story short, I spoke to the shop who originally sold me the MacBook Pro. They mentioned there is a possibility that they could fix it. And they did!… not only that, I did NOT lose any data!!!!Bottom line:Apple quoted USD 2900 to replace the MLB.. with DATA LOSS.By avoiding Apple's way of doing business, the repair cost USD 300 with NO DATA LOSS  !!Now I just need to put this sleek high-end mobile device on a special desk, encase it in an air conditioned glass case and keep it off grid with its own dedicated power source. Then maybe, just maybe it wont decide to kill itself again for no apparent reason.The industry should be more regulated. Depending on these devices, that are clearly not reliable, can have an adverse affect on many aspects of our lives, including our ability to communicate with the world around us and what we put into our rice bowls.It's VERY clear that Apple do NOT have the best interests of their customers in mind. Not to mention the wellbeing of the planet.

"Apple puts plastic on the menu ...My problem is with the Apple Inc policy that they do not allow OS updates for older, yet still working fine phones. Because of this policy, a phone that still works well cannot get the new OS required for other app updates.This is, to me, a FORCED CASH SPEND and it is also environmentally irresponsible. With this policy Apple consigns thousands of phones to the dump creating waste when they would not be there if people could get the latest OS update and be able to then properly use the third-party apps like InstaGram. Times are economically tough around the world these days. Why force people to spend unnecessarily? Why create more waste with phones sent to the dumpster when that waste is unecessary and can be fixed with a simple policy change allowing OS updates?

Apple is placing more of it on the menu with this draconian policy of not allowing OS updates on older phone models like the iPhone5S.

Drove an hour to do that then was told they do not have that equipment at the store. Turns out it should have been easily solvable over the phone if the agent would just have done a screen share. Told it was not 'policy' to do a call with third party providers even when the issues are interoperability. Seems like each time I call customer service it is someone else's fault. I work from an Apple, with the higher price I would expect there to be less problems not more than PCs. Work with your third parties not against them and the customer. Had to go through reinstall off software and Op System even though I not of those made any sense and proved not to be the case. Need some problem solving thinking training and true diagnostic skills rather than just following the book and inconveniencing customers.

"DO NOT Buy Apple ProductsSo we recently visited the Regent Street store (we live on the Isle of Wight) having hit brick walls trying to report our iPad fault online, for our kit, still well within the one year warranty. At our technician appointment it starts well and, close to the end of our time together, he indicates how immaculate our kit is and starts to offer a brand new iPad. For clarity our fault was the charging port not working w/no visible damage. Suddenly he then guides he has to send it away for the repair team to review. Btw we appreciate it’s not our technician steering this, but the dictatorial Apple repair ‘decision tree’ .We reluctantly agree. Four working days later the repair team notify us, via email, to say it’s water damaged ( genuinely impossible given limited usage usually in the expensive docking station ) and it will cost nearly £700 to fix. We try to escalate (though given no access to a process to allow us to do this) and decline asking for it to be returned so we can then look what we do next. The biggest kick in the teeth?

I chose to splash out on a 13"" IPadPro, + so-called 'Magic Keyboard', for use mainly when not at home (where I have a large iMac). I am so disappointed with the Pro's huge heavy weight! It is so heavy even to lug around the house, let alone on trains and planes. I'm disappointed that its weightiness did not hit my radar AT ALL when choosing the product. Now, after some time of using it, I just find it seriously tedious. It also tips over all the time when using it! And are Apple at all bothered? I doubt it. There's nowhere to do reviews that I can find on their website! My advice?  Don't waste your money!Further, Apple Packaging is a disgrace in this day and age. So environmentally unfriendly.

"Airpod proRight now, there are 4 series of airpods which are made by Apple. The Airpods (1st generation) released in 2016, Airpods (2nd generation) released in 2019, Airpods Pro released in 2019 and Airpods Max released in 2020. Mostly all of these are approximately priced more than 150$ and can be up to 549$ with the latest series. From my perspective, I didn’t use other airpods here the reasons why.Firstly, the airpods 1 have no active noise cancellation, which means outside noise may interfere with user listening experiences. Short battery life around 5 hours of listening time and 2 hours of talking time for 1 single charge, this may not be enough for some users. Airpods 1 might work well with Apple devices, they may not work well with other brand devices, and some features might be limited or not available at all. Additionally, some users have reported that there are connection issues with older system devices.Secondly, the airpods 2 lack water resistance, which means they can be damaged internally by water splashes, sweat and rain. Airpods 2 don’t have active noise cancellation. Also short battery life around 5 hours if listening time and 3 hours of talking time on single charge.Lastly, The AirPods Max are one of the most expensive headphones on the overall headphone market. It is very bulky and heavy to carry around. The Airpods Max are heavier and bulkier than other popular headphones, which make the users feel uncomfortable wearing them for many hours. There is no power-off button on Airpods Max, which means they are always in a low-power battery mode, even when they are not in use. This makes the battery life feel shorter for some users. Lastly, airpods max do not support lossless audio, which means you may not be able to enjoy highest quality audio files.I have been using airpods pro for approximately 3 years now. The reasons why I bought airpods pro are active noise cancellation, comfortable carrying around and better compatibility with ios and other devices. The ios make the airpods pro easy to connect to other apple devices. The battery life is acceptable, the battery of the airpods pro lasts about 4.5 hours with active noise cancellation turned on. It can also connect and be compatible with other devices with bluetooth.However, there are some flaws. After using it for many years, the microphone doesn’t work for me anymore. When I use it for phone calls I need to change to the original microphone instead of using the airpods microphone. The earbuds are also damaged and worn out making the sound not contained in the ear also making the noise cancellation  doesn’t work. Later, when I figured out that I needed to buy new earbuds, I found out that Apple only gives me 1 pair of each earbud size (small, medium, and large). I decided to buy new earbuds from another brand because apple earbuds are really expensive.As a result, I think that Apple Airpods pro is the best series compared to the other series. It might not be affordable for everyone, however I think it is totally worth it if you want to buy new wireless headphones.Date of experience:March 06, 2022",70,Bhurin Srikhirin,5,Thailand,2023-03-06 00:00:00.000000,active user short single available lack active short single expensive overall heavy popular uncomfortable many lossless able audio pro active comfortable pro easy acceptable active connect compatible many original sound noise new small large new result pro worth new,Positive

I am going to the States shortly again and I was going to buy another MacBook and now it looks like iPad as well.   I guess the lesson learned is that you have to pay the Apple care monthly plan, if you do the annual plan you only get an extra year of cover.

"Apple IncApple IncI am writing this letter to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the services provided by your company, Apple. I am a loyal customer of your products and have been using Apple products for many years. However, my recent experience with your company has been very disappointing and frustrating.I recently had to replace the battery on my iPhone xs, and I was told to pay $100. I did pay that and got the battery replaced. Since the battery replacement, my touch screen has become unresponsive, and I am unable to use my phone effectively. I have tried to get in touch with your customer service representatives several times, but I have not received any satisfactory response. At first, Apple support said that it will be fixed for free under a program that you offer. I was given an appointment to go to the Apple store in Mississauga, ON. However, when I went there the lady said, my iPhone isn't covered. It's iPhone X, not iPhone XS. Very appalling service to be sent for repair without the proper information. I had to take half day off. I called customer service and spoke to senior advisors who said they will try to see what they can do and help me with the situation, as this happened after battery replacement and then taking off from work to go to the store(which was futile).I am extremely disappointed that Apple has not stood by what it promised to deliver. As a customer, I expect a certain level of quality and service from your company, and it is clear that this has not been met. I have invested a significant amount of money in your products, and I expect them to function properly.I request that you take immediate action to resolve this issue and provide me with a satisfactory solution. I hope that you will stand by your reputation for providing excellent customer service and quality products. If this issue is not resolved soon, I will be forced to consider other options for my technology needs.Thank you for taking the time to read my complaint. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Sincerely,HarryDate of experience:February 21, 2023",35,Harry K,1,Canada,2023-02-24 00:00:00.000000,deep loyal many recent unresponsive unable touch several satisfactory fixed free appointment covered appalling proper senior futile disappointed certain level clear significant immediate satisfactory excellent read,Positive

"Password not working, but existshad an issue with my password not working and called Apple to get it resolved.  I repeatedly got hung up on when I pointed out that the representatives were not listening to the problem or the fact that I had already tried all the normal steps.  When I finally was transferred to '3rd' level customer support and had to repeat everything again twice, I was told that I need to erase my system and did not even try to resolve it any other way.  The lady did not even suggest that I try to reinstall the OS.  She didn't even know whether the reinstall would erase the data that was there or not.  I asked how I could get the data off the drive first, she suggested that I could call a data recovery service.  I spoke to a few more '3rd' level techs, all of which knew less about the OS than I did.  None wanted to take responsibility for their lack of knowledge and simply find someone to help me properly.  I can and did simply go to the web and find out how to simply copy the data.  Sure, I could have gone to a data recovery service and paid $100-$500 to do this for me, but why?  I can easily follow directions about using Terminal and do it with a few simple commands, but none of them would help me find the commands.  All they really needed to do was point me to the right place on Apple's website to do so or have someone knowledgeable give me the commands.  While, I don't know linux, I do know a bit about programming, so it was not an issue with just a few bits of information.  Something that could have been easily handled with a real technical support, was mismanaged from every encounter.  The error was based an issue with their operating system and no one would take responsibility for that and find and real resolution.  I even pointed out that the password work for the recovery, just not in the normal sign in mode, which goes to prove the issue was the OS.  Furthermore, I could see the files and therefore there was no need to erase and could easily be copied.

To date, I have had nothing but problems with the phone.  I have frequently returned to Apple and highlighted the issues as I cannot access both my gmail or yahoo emails from the inbox.  The excuses by staff who suggested the phone was not compatible with the internet platform yahoo, is a joke.  They have downloaded both the yahoo and gmail app so that I can access my emails rather than the inbox which is ridiculous.  The customer support feature on google is barred from my phone (0844 209 0611) and I have been left for weeks now without any inbox.  The inbox receives emails if any and states 'cannot get mail', 'the connection to the server failed', 'this message has not been downloaded from the server'.  The phone is not fit for purpose.  I have demanded Apple either exchange the phone to something that does work or refund me in full.

Unacceptable in my mind given I have friends with Sonos systems still going strong after 6+ years at a similar price point.They just launched the next gen HomePod - but I’d stay away as their support for first gen has been absolutely abysmal.Date of experience:February 16, 2023",31,Sean,1,United Kingdom,2023-02-16 00:00:00.000000,old double light unacceptable strong similar next first,Positive

"Stolen parcel from delivery driverI ordered the iPhone 14 pro max from apple and driver mose Issa a DPD driver came to my door and delivered a box with no address on it and inside was an empty iPhone 13 box. I reported it to apple and gave them a police reference and all the evidence. It took a week for the investigation to be over. Apple emailed me saying they completed the review with the carrier mose Issa regarding the shipment and said it was successfully delivered and they refused to refund or send me a new phone. The DPD delivery driver mose did a really sneaky and evil messed up thing. I asked for proof of the delivery but no one from DPD or apple sent me any proof the delivery driver mose Issa sent to them. I then spoke to one of the managers of DPD and they briefly described to me what the image the delivery driver sent looks like. It was an image of my door opened and the parcel on the floor. What the delivery driver did was put my actual delivery on the floor. Waited for my mum to open the door and he gave her the empty box, he took a picture of the actual package on the floor to show it’s been delivered, then he took the parcel back with him. DPD and Apples customer service was absolutely horrible. No one was willing to help me with this stolen package from a DPD driver that they in-trusted my parcel with. I’m going to take further action if apple and DPD don’t fix up and reopen this case and send me a new phone! I would have put 0 for the review if there was an option to.

"Apple Support Sucks 👎Apple has repeatedly allowed brands (ie. VSCO) to charge customers after customers cancelled their services way before the designated time. Apple is now noticeably losing customers because of such, and such is indeed warranted.

But I got the phone back and the screen protector was removed without informing me. When I said that I wasn't too happy about that, the answer was that that was needed. I said I was not informed and like to make a complaint, that was not possible! Seriously, not possible, the arrogance.

"Refuses to refund double even though they acknowledge that I was double charged!I purchased a pack on an iOS game. I received an email receipt from Apple the next day showing I was charged twice for it. I filed a dispute online. It was denied. I disputed it and included more details. That was denied. I called Apple support on the phone. The representative said that they can’t overturn denied cases. I asked point blank if they are acknowledging that they know that I was double charged due to a glitch on their end and that they refuse to refund me for it, and she said yes. Well, she did say she would refund me if she could, but that she couldn’t because she had to follow Apple policy.I contacted the game company and explained the situation. I asked if they could push down another pack on my device since I paid for two and Apple refused to refund me for the duplicate charge. They checked their logs and saw what I said was true and sent another in-game pack. Now THAT is how customer service is done. Apple is straight up stealing from me. I don’t care if it’s $10 or $1k, I won’t trust a company with big purchase if they blatantly steal. And many others have experienced this too as I’ve seen in similar posts.I’ve purchased multiple iPhones, iPads, iPods, AirPods, iwatches, smart pens, MacBooks, and other Apple devices over the years.

"Disappointed and DistraughtIn 2019, I bought a brand new MacBook Air. Three years later... The screen stopped working. I tried all that I could do. I went to the Apple store, and I had a guy - Abe - look at it, came back, said it was a software issue and it worked. I went back to school because I was in a rush, and BOOM my computer was in the same black-screened state. I went back five days later, and another worker - Will - sent it to see if it could get replaced under some ""quality program"" for free and if they found no issues, it would be replaced similarly to a ""recall"". Two days later, I get an email saying hardware issues were suddenly found and I was asked to pay $500 to repair it. Why I found that suspicious is because, I have a case on the laptop, around the laptop, and it is in my backpack. Mind you, it is the heaviest item in my backpack and I do not drop or throw my backpack around. Went back to the Apple store and the same guy - Will - suggested to not get it fixed and rather replace it. Oh of course, so that you can get more money. I called Apple Support to get further, in depth details as to why my computer was damaged. Talked to an Advisor - Joe - and he escalated me to a Senior Advisor - Lance - to talk to. Whenever I asked Lance for what the specific issues were, he was indirect, unclear, and unhelpful. I had a friend also ask questions, and magically, he pulls out a random hardware issue when he could have said that from the get go. There was nothing that could be done on their part (apparently). We had a Senior Advisor repeating the same four words the entire conversation and saying that I had to pay HALF the price I bought the computer for to repair it when there was no CLEAR issue that could have been caused by me. Water damage, physical damage, sure that's my fault. But having a brand new laptop for THREE years with no irresponsible thrashing or water damage, that I paid $1300 for, and it just suddenly stops working sounds ridiculous.

They then agreed to revise the evaluation after I called to complain and when I sent the phone back, they lost it in their facility and charged me for the amount they had given me initially. They sent the phone back to me once they found it and then after I sent it for a third time (it was the charm) they evaluated it at the full credit initially offered. This entire process lasted almost three months with constant calling and checking in on my part, because if I hadn’t, nothing would’ve taken place as half the time they didn’t even know what I was talking about.

"Apple has the poorest customer service I have ever experiencedI bought a 14ProMax for my daughter online through Apple Store, even got the AppleCare+ in case we ever needed a repair.

From my notifications, it was not left there for more than 5 minutes before my daughter went out and took the package in. She opened it while I was at work and frantically texted me saying that the box was empty. Long story short, delivery box was sealed but there was no phone, no packaging even, inside the sealed brown box. Called Apple when I got home, about 4 hours after delivery, the customer service person was super nice, saying not to worry, the great thing about the Apple company was the customer service and they would investigate and mail us a new phone probably within 10 days and to look out for an email regarding the investigation. I got an email alright, saying that the investigation has been closed and nothing will be done!!!!! I, of course, called Apple support again, this time the representative was not helpful at all, telling me there's nothing they would do. And to just contact the police!!First off, I have been a Samsung user and it's my daughter that convinced me to give her an iphone.

"Apple Censors Women & Colludes with the Erosion of Child SafegaurdingApple is colluding with certain applications like Instagram & others in censoring customer reviews that harm their top stakeholder’s investment in astroturfed product “social proofs” (like the expanding synthetic sex ID market & sexploitation market). Apple store’s application has repeatedly hidden reviews of apps when I have pointed out that an app (like instagram) is censoring women who say things like woman equals adult human female, or that women are not ideas in a man’s head, fetish, costume, skin perforations, or vibes, while that same app will allow imagery of child exploitation like kiddiesnuff, such as halfnude children gasping in plastic bags and tied halfnude to beds with legs splayed, with instagram claiming this is allowable art. Even if I smash keywords together that might trigger an algorithm in order to avoid the algorithm, these reviews that criticize a platform’s censorship of women and endorsement of the erosion of child safegaurding are removed from public view. So Apple does not allow genuine reviews. You can criticize that same app for racism, but Apple does not want the public to become aware of the scale of discrimination against women and exploitation of children. So I have noticed that over and over again, those two key topics are not allowed to publicly post in Apple’s app store reviews. Therefore Apple is colluding with the kiddie cutting cult, and crafting the appearance of our social compliance with this exploitation campaign. They do this even as Paypal, Youtube, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and Twitter bans women who push back against erasure, and recently Apple blocked the app Telegram across all devices which allows censored citizens to speak and share news, citations, stats, and resources without the censorship of digital marketers purging dissidents. Companies like Apple are destroying the ability of citizens to raise awareness, and organize protest against abusive corporatist overreach.Date of experience:January 16, 2023",7,DeeJay,1,United States,2023-01-16 00:00:00.000000,certain social synthetic human fetish child allowable algorithm endorsement public genuine public aware scale social telegram speak digital organize abusive,Positive

"""The customer is not a moron. She's your wife."" (David Ogilvy)The apple app. store earns 30% from the applications they sell. I assume that as a seller they help their customer with problems and, if necessary, approach the supplier to find a solution. But in reality their customer support is to listen in a courteous manner, and then, by definition, to prove the consumer wrong. Their creativity for this is phenomenal! Thereby ignoring any legal obligation, or effort to help the customer.Date of experience:January 13, 2023",1,Marc,1,Belgium,2023-01-13 00:00:00.000000,necessary courteous wrong phenomenal thereby legal,Negative
"Apple Customer Alienation Dept Refuses to Stand Behind Their ProductsI purchased a $50 iPhone case from Apple online store.  After a few months, the case began falling apart and the phone would literally fall out of the case.  I contacted Apple, which is an unbelievably difficult task to accomplish.  They initiated a case number and warranty claim.  This resulted in me being passed between 6 reps and hours on hold.  All the while each rep promised me that the case would be replaced and they would make sure the problem was resolved.  Eventually, after 4 days of back and forth they connected me to a guy that says he has resolved the problem and all I need to do is start over and go elsewhere as Apple has absolutely zero responsibility for their own product failures.  Even though they lured me into buying it, took the money and profit and maintained the relationship, now they drop the ball completely.  Of course I can always try to contact the original manufacturer but why promise me so much and waste so much of my time only to conclude that their customer service department is a complete waste of space?  If they had been upfront from the start, it would be much less of a customer service failure.  But now I have deeply negative feelings about Apple.  All over an overpriced phone case.  This is a classic textbook example of customer alienation, not customer service.Date of experience:January 12, 2023",1,David Bragg,1,United States,2023-01-13 00:00:00.000000,difficult accomplish rep sure contact original much much conclude complete negative classic,Negative
"IPhone 11 is garbageI bought an iPhone 11 a year and a half ago. Terrible phone. It started restarting on its own. Spent hours with customer service. They said it’s probably the motherboard.

"Apple you are devious. You seem determined to make it as difficult as possible for customers seeking redressIn June 2021 I bought a high spec 24” iMac at a cost of £2,500 from the UK Apple Store.I was very happy until, out of the blue, it failed completely on 14th December 2022 in the middle of a Teams call.I was not able to restart it. I contacted Apple who ran through some basic diagnostics and advised me to take it to an authorised repairer. I was told that my iMac was out-of-warranty as it was more that 1 year old, the implication being that I would need to pay for a repair.I delivered it to an iStore in Guildford on 16th December 2022.On the 20th December 2022 the iStore informed me that in addition to the £90 diagnostic fee I had already paid I would need to pay £475 for a new Logic Board.This seemed outrageous for a product that was 18-months old. On reviewing my rights as a consumer I wrote to Apple. The letter included the following:The Consumer Rights Act 2015 makes it an implied term of the contract I have with Apple that goods be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality.As you are in breach of contract and I've owned the product between 6 months and 6 years, I am within my statutory rights to ask for it to be repaired.The reply came back that I had sent this to the wrong place in Apple and I should contact Apple Care.22 December 2022 - I speak to an advisor - John - who assures me he will take ownership and resolve the issue for me. He sounds very uncertain and hesitant when he learns that I am referencing consumer rights law to require Apple to pay for the repair. However, he eventually gives the iStore the go-ahead to complete the repair. He sends me a link to a site that allows me to leave a message and /or voicemail for him if I need further help.6 January 2023 - iStore inform me that they have tried various ways to fix the iMac but nothing works. They are at a loss as to how to repair it. I contact John via the link he has sent me but get no response.8 January 2023 - I call Apple Support and speak to Daniela who assures me she understands how frustrating this is and she will now take ownership of the case and resolve my issue. At this stage I ask for a like-for-like replacement of the iMac since it appears to be impossible to repair. She needs to talk to another department in Apple to see if this can be done but as they do not work on weekends cannot progress it further. She promises to call me the next day.9 January 2023 - Daniela calls and says that she has confirmed with the iStore that they do not know how to repair it. She tells me that I need to collect the faulty iMac from the iStore and when I have it to let her know so that she can see if the machine can be replaced. When I question why I need to collect it to send to them rather than have the iStore send it to them and why she could not guarantee that it would be exchanged, her response was that this is how we do things and there can be no deviation from that.10 January 2023 - I call the iStore to arrange to collect the faulty iMac the following day.11 January 2023 - The iStore text me to say that they are not sure that they can have the iMac reassembled in time to collect that day. I contact Apple Support to express my frustration with the process. I speak to Paulo who assures me he understands my frustration and that he will now take ownership and resolve my problem. When I insist that I need progress on the replacement he proceeds to process a like-for-like replacement order even though I do not yet have the iMac in my possession. He asks me to ensure the iStore repair order completion is sent to him stating that the device is not repairable. While talking to him a text comes through telling me that the iMac is ready for collection from the iStore. I pick up the faulty iMac and the iStore immediately volunteer a refund of the £90 diagnostic fee (well done iStore!) and send me the repair order completion. I forward the repair order completion immediately to Paulo via the link he sent me and as a reply to the email (belt and braces).12 January 2023 - update to followDate of experience:January 12, 2023",31,David Puttick,1,United Kingdom,2023-01-15 00:00:00.000000,devious difficult possible high happy middle able basic old diagnostic new logic outrageous old purpose satisfactory statutory ask wrong uncertain hesitant complete various contact ask impossible faulty collect text say sure collect express speak process possession text ready volunteer diagnostic update,Positive

After a screen share session and much effort  I was told the computer was probably not working.  So I returned it and purchased an upgrade iMac.  The same thing happened though.  I then called tech support 3 different times to see if they can help me connect my newer iMac bluetooth to my iPhone.  After sensing a bit of  confusion l I was wondering why tech support seemed quite uninformed about this issue. Not one of the 4 calls resulted in clarity that bluetooth is not supported or necessary. For such info I was able to discover within my own research that these devise do not connect via bluetooth.  The airdrop is automatically supported between devices.  It took a lot of back and for with Apple, and a big hassle it was to say the least.  I just wonder why tech support did not know this basic info.

"Very bad purchase experienceAn important purchase from the Apple Store became a nightmare just because I was abroad when I placed the order. Endless calls and chats just to explain the situation and reschedule the shipment, with the result that my item was still delivered to someone else without my consent and no one can explain to whom or why - at the moment I have no idea if I will ever find it when I get home.

"My final word on Apple.I fail to understand how this company is even in business let alone successful. Or actually I do, they prey on the fact that people will pay exorbiant amounts of money to get nothing so long as others do it too and its “cool” or everyone else is doing it. The iphone se I am using right now I sincerely regret buying and to think I had considered the iphone 13. Its a bunch of hot garbage. Who needs a logo with a bite taken out when something as trivial as typing is an absolute pain in the a$$. Like my fingers are in pain just writing this review and thats saying something because on my old motorolla phone (the most budget 200$ phone you could buy) my fingers never hurt and typing was fine. The app store is a garbage dump of ads and lousy apps that constantly spam you with ads and ask for money. The google play store is superior in every way. Even the reviews on the app store are biased to apples content since they claim mainstream apps only have a couple thousand reviews which is obviously nonsense. (Or the alternative that apple deletes reviews they don’t like) But on top of that you only get to see a few of the preselected reviews they want you to see. My home screen looks like someone threw up on it and is practically unusable. The customiztions are almost nonexistent and changing how it looks is such a pain you just want to throw your phone in the trash. I disabled autocorrect because not once did it help it just made an already awful typing experience worse so I am used to autocorrecting myself and constantly having to retype what I wrote (case in point has to retype “wrote” 3 times). I can’t so much as rearrange the order of apps let alone make a gap between them so I can make things look as they should and be more productive. Why are so many people high on the cameras? I find the photos to be okay at best and the night mode on the se is nonexistent. If the lighting is bad the photo looks like it was shot on some cheap camera from a 10 dollar drone you ordered from aliexpress if that. Shall I continue? I’ll take that as a yes (your fault you chose to read on) when I make a damn hotspot it not only takes about a full minute to actually turn on, it also will randomly turn off for no good reason and yes, it was actively connected. Yes I checked ever online tip and article in existence yeah I burned another 30 braincells and valuable time on this awful company. In my dads words “the iphone isn’t fun to use but I survive” he’s right and I respect that but I’ll let my standards dictate what I’m going to survive on and if the most widespread phone brand fails to do that, then I won’t be using them anymore. Thank god I didn’t buy a macbook or airpods they are somehow worse and I haven’t gotten the pain of experiencing it firsthand yet. Lets do better people spend the hour or two with a trusted friend or website finding your needs and buy something you will actually enjoy using in the future. Maybe even for old times sake when people bothered using their brains once in a while, pull out that trusty notebook you never actually used and jot down some standards for what you want not what they want cause that I canspell out for you; YOUR-MONEY (Save a hot load of money too think free music and the ability to download stuff like apks or customize your homescreen or not pay anymore subscriptions or just upfront pay half the price for one hell of a better piece of tech that has been forced to innovate and prove itself.)Date of experience:December 30, 2022",87,Yonah Greene,1,Israel,2022-12-31 00:00:00.000000,final successful prey long right regret bunch hot bite trivial old fine superior content nonsense alternative top want unusable nonexistent awful retype much productive many high nonexistent bad cheap chose read damn full good tip valuable awful survive right survive widespread somehow worse enjoy future old trusty hot free innovate,Positive
"Apple HomepodWe are a family of loyal Apple users for many years. This includes subscriptions to iCloud and Apple Music and TV. We also have phones and computers. We love them because the just work without too many issues. The exception to this is the Homepod. We have two of these which although sound good for a small speaker have daily connection problems. This seems to be a known issue. Sometimes one speaker doesn't play then suddenly starts working again. Often our Ipad loses the bluetooth connection and you have to reset the Homepods even though they are situated within a metre of the Ipad. We initially thought it was our internet but we had if checked and it isn't the case. This seems to be a known issue with them according to the forums. The voice recognition is good but BBC have not authorised Apple to use this. Eg "" Hey Siri Play BBC Radio Two"" It cant do this unlike other devices. We have several lights connected to Apple Home and they seem to work well although we purchased a plug which never worked well and is now in the bin. Being honest we probably wouldn't buy anymore of theses as you spend lots of time reseting and they are really frustrating. Sometimes an old fashioned stereo are just better. Sorry Apple but these are really not up to your normal high standards.

"I was Sick ~ Six Months after opening MacBookI have exhausted all efforts to resolve this issue with Best Buy, meeting requirements for a refund, and even followed their recommendation to contact Apple directly for the resolution, and have been refused a solution to my issue at every turn:1. I purchased a MacBook Air & a customhardshell case for that computer online atBest Buy and picked it up, 11/29/21 on12/1/21. ~ $ 1,2362. I called on the last day of the return window,telling best buy reps at the store, at thephone number on the back of the credit card,and at the geek squad desk that Ican’t use the product nor the case designedspecifically for the product.3. I described my Allergic reaction, which beganupon opening the product’s factory sealedcellophane & box, becoming severe within ~a minute or so, and was the same typeof allergic reaction that I have had in the pastto Mold/MRSA exposure4. Luckily, I had both rescue inhaler andepinephrine auto inject pens in case ofanother exposure. I contracted a serioussinus (MRSA) infection, ill 9 days afteropening the seal & required Specialistappointments at $ 35.00 each & specializedmeds, lasting thru May/June ~ $ 3005. Best Buy, after several calls & disconnects,said I couldn’t return nor exchange it, I had totry Apple.6. Apple directed me, after several calls toSimply Mac to have it evaluated on site &then return & exchange could be processed…7. Simply Mac evaluated it & tried several timesover several weeks to get in touch withApple, with no luck. They told me to callApple back.8. Again, I tried to resolve the issue with Apple.After several days of calls, where I wasinterrogated by the Risk managementdepartment, they said it was not theirproblem and the Mold/MRSA came fromBest Buy.9. Eventually I tried the My Best Buy credit cardcompany and have been re-sending the samedata over and over again.

"Apple warrantyI had the misfortune of buying an Apple Watch as a Christmas present for my daughter in 2020 ( I purchased the watch in October and put it away ).  As it now turns out it was bought way to early as I was under the misguided thinking that the warranty kicks in when the product is activated and not when purchased and how wrong I was.My daughter decided to wear the watch on Christmas Day as it had not been worn in a while ( but had been charged ) and it would not activate. It registered on her phone and on the find my iPhone app. We tried factory reset but to no avail.Today was the first opportunity I had to contact an authorised Apple repair centre and explained my case and was told that I MAY be able to get it repaired under European consumer law ( two year warranty ). I was then told to contact Apple to see would they authorise the repair but was passed to a manager who was very quick to tell me that I had mentioned European consumer law to one of his customer service agents and it was a legal process and they must adhere to the law. He clearly stated that Apple should have been informed within the two years but as I previously wrote above I incorrectly thought the warranty kicks in on activation. He did offer a replacement at approximately the cost of a new watch but I politely declined. If a two year warranty is a legal matter for Apple then why are their authorised sellers offering two year warranties. I would just encourage anyone thinking of buying an apple product to make themselves very familiar with the Apple warranty ( and what is included ) , it’s starting date and also their rights under European law. I would encourage consumers to contact Apple if they have any issues with their apple products well within their warranty period and to clarify if they are entitled to the extended warranty under European law ( at no cost ). I know that it’s over the two year since purchase but surely you would expect an Apple product to last longer than two years.Date of experience:December 28, 2022",65,RJ,2,Ireland,2022-12-28 00:00:00.000000,present wrong wear watch registered tried first able quick legal new warranty legal familiar warranty last,Positive

Target won't give me back my money because on the receipt it under everygift card I bought  ""once it's activated that it is no longer returnable""Apple says they will only stand behind their product if we had bought it at an Apple store or  Apple online. My issue with that is if you know you have problems Apple why are you selling it at 3rd party locations that you refuse to stand behind like Walmart and target....

"One star just for the first RepresentativeThe only reason I even put one star is because of the original rep who placed my order via phone.This sale(delivery) was such a bad experience, I was even cursed at and threatened )veiled threat) by the delivery driver (Uber, yes Uber),my product returned and now scrambling to try and get it by Christmas.I placed an order over the phone with a GREAT rep, she explained if I wanted before Christmas for $9.00 the product will be delivered by Monday (basically two days) by “courier”. Wow, how can you pass that up, right? She explained someone has to be at the delivery location at a scheduled time to sign for it. Knowing I couldn’t be there I gave specific instructions on where to bring it and someone who will sign(yes after the incident I checked the order it’s there).I got a call six times in a row on delivery day, I kept ignoring it, finally I picked up and scream (and cursed) who the *** is this? The person said Uber…I immediately said don’t call this number again and hung up. Another call and I picked up and screamed didn’t I said don’t ******* call this number? He screamed yo I got a delivery for you from Apple..I told well you got instructions on what do go do it don’t call… than he said to watch the way you talk mother****** you a tough guy on the phone you think you a gangster punk mother****** , come down let’s see what happens to you…Anyway my wife stopped me from running there…I got an email saying order cannot be delivered, it’s being returned to the store and refund issued….I waited about a hour or two calmed down, and called Apple. I explained what happened and they said now I have to replace the order and won’t be available for delivery till after Christmas, which I can’t understand, store, less than a mile alway and they are using Uber for deliveries, the latest or should have been able to be delivered with three days, really a hour to correct this mistake. The support person me she’ll connect me with a sales rep and maybe they can get it deliveeed earlier than Christmas.Now speaking with a sales rep, who I’m assuming is in the actual store (btw no such thing to speak to one from a store) this person tells me they don’t have this item in stock at the store at this time (mind you there’s a butt load of these products there I found out later and my order was just returned) I asked if he’s in the store he said no I’m in the sales department (not in a retail location)I waited a couple of hours decided to call the store directly, for a person, he said there is a lot of them in stock, and I figured he’s in the store cause I called the store number (guess what he’s not, it gets routed to Apples sales centers which is not a retail location)Now I’m forced to try to find time to go to this store and pick up the new order all because a “courier” (Uber driver) didnt want to get out of his car to bring the delivery into a store for a signature as the delivery instructions stated.It was a horrible and disgusting experience.The fact that Apple didn’t offer a comparable solution to the matter (placing the order and having redelivered immediately by “courier”),  or allowing people to speak with a person ina a physical retail location, and allowing these Uber drivers make deliveries for them is crazy.They don’t understand this is Nyc Uber drivers aren’t getting out of their cars to make deliveries cause they one, to lazy, two can, in that short time get a stack of parking tickets.Date of experience:December 19, 2022",2,Mitchell K,1,United States,2022-12-20 00:00:00.000000,first original bad veiled great rep wow specific call row call call watch tough come refund available mile able correct connect rep actual speak retail guess retail find pick new horrible comparable courier physical retail short stack,Positive

"Hard to trust employee informationTo Whom It May Concern:I am writing today to complain of the poor service and advice I received from Sherway Mall’s Apple store employee on November 30, 2022 that led me to purchase a fake iPhone and lose 1500$ in the process. I walked in to purchase a new iPhone 14 pro Nov 30th 2022 where the following took place:Your Apple employee advised me that there were no iPhone 14 pro’s available in stock and that I would have to reserve one by adding my name to a reservation list. The iPhone 14 pro would only arrive on December 28th. Unfortunately, this date would not work as I was scheduled to leave the country December 16, 2022. To my surprise, the employee proceeded to advise me that since I would be out of country Dec 28th, he could NOT add me to the reservation list.I proceeded to search the mall at all electronic stores who are licensed to sell Apple products/iPhone in attempt to locate said iPhone. With no luck, and no choice quite frankly, I started looking for iPhones in the online market. I located one on Facebook marketplace from an individual selling a brand-new iPhone boxed with receipt of purchase. This seemed legitimate, however, to be cautious and prior to completing this transaction, I phoned the Apple store at Yorkdale mall. This is where I spoke to an employee who verified the purchase based on the information on the receipt. The seller’s reason for selling was that “his father wasn’t an iPhone guy”. Your Apple employee assured and verified that this iPhone in question was in fact real according to the serial number and information on its receipt. However, once the transaction and exchange took place, I got home and quickly attempted to sync my iPhone with this new one only to learn that I had been scammed and this was a fake iPhone.Not only am I annoyed that I wasted a morning getting inaccurate information, being turned away by an Apple employee, but in turn due to my time constraints, I looked at other options one being to purchase an iPhone online (from a con artist).My impression of Apple has been tarnished, and I am now considering getting rid of all Apple products. I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years! My whole family has iPhones, iPhone watches, iPads, Apple desktop and laptops (including my businesses). Furthermore, your customer service representative gave inaccurate information when in fact I came to find out that Apple receives iPhones every two days if you walk in during shipment days you have an opportunity to get one (alternative to being put on the reservation list). Had I known this information, I would have made a more informed decision and gladly returned to purchase my new iPhone with confidence at an Apple store. Your service representative’s inability to provide accurate information has caused me duress, incurred expense relating to $1500 lost to a fake iPhone & now also a lost loyal customer. I would like to note that I have contacted police to file a report and they are unable to assist in these online fraud instances.I trust this is not the way Apple wishes to conduct business with valued customers—I have been with you for many years and have never encountered such treatment before. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss matters further and to learn how you propose to prevent a similar situation from recurring. I look forward to hearing from you.Date of experience:November 30, 2022",4,Emanuel,1,Canada,2022-12-19 00:00:00.000000,hard poor mall lose new pro pro available unfortunately leave electronic luck receipt legitimate cautious prior real serial new inaccurate due rid loyal whole inaccurate shipment reservation informed new representative accurate loyal note file unable trust many propose similar forward,Positive

Why would I have your Apple Company hold my money for a defective product they sent out to me? Why not send out a replacement and then if you don’t get the return back charge me for it? It makes me think this Company is too greedy to please the Customer who has put their faith in them to provide quality products. I’m very turned off by this Company and will no longer support them.

"Apple Store- Stratford- best experience ever.Apple Store- Stratford-Review.My kids had a consistent Apple IPAD Charger challenges.All efforts to rectify this became a pain in the bum because my kids so stressed me out to fix it.Fom one roadside charger to another and not working afterwards.Until I thought why not go to Apple directly, whom I bought both IPADs from.I popped into 02 Store in Woolwich and asked for Apple IPAD chargers.The agent told me both chargers would set me aback by £48.I screamed because I had been used to buying roadside chargers for £10 max, which stopped working a week after.I took the risk and bought both chargers for £48 and for the next 7 months, I had respite from my kids - no more charger challenge anymore, until recently when both chargers stopped working and all hell was let lose.My kids are so used to their IPADs the way I am so used to my smart phone. So I know what they are going through each time they can't get their IPAD to work.I went back to the 02 store for warranty replacement and was told to contact Apple directly.I did and Apple fixed an appointment for me to pop into their nearest store at Stratford to get the items replaced.I visited apple Stratford and got both chargers replaced, bran new without any questions.At Apple shop Stratford, I was not only wowed by their excellent customer service amidst a huge endless crowd, I was bowled over by Apples display of a vast array of 21st century gadgets, ranging from smart iPhones to tablets and PCs.And I remembered Steve Jobs of blessed memory and his subsisting legacy, the Apple brand. May he continue to RIP.I advise all and sundry, should you ever wish to purchase, any smart phones, tablets and PCs, please go to Apple for quality, and after care service.Because you have purchased from Apple, (any product, even outside waranty) Apple will continue to look after you and that product for life.Eg 2 IPADs (8 generation- 2020) I bought for my kids at the cost of £450 each...Even when it was outside warranty when my younger daughter (8yr old) had her screen broken, Apple offered me same product, bran new replacement at the cost of £200 (which I considered to be a very ridiculous PRIZE).No seller out there will do similar.Hence I said if you must buy any smart phones, tablet or PCs, for Quality and your own peace of mind, pls buy ONLY from Apple cos Apple will look after u and your product for life...Now, that's just a thought on Apple, Steve Jobs legacy..May he continue to RIP.Date of experience:December 12, 2022",4,Doro Oddiri,5,United Kingdom,2022-12-13 00:00:00.000000,consistent fix next smart appointment bran new excellent huge vast array smart sundry wish smart outside outside old new ridiculous smart,Positive

In the end they wanted to charge me £297 for a chip in the screen which wasn't there before I sent off for diagnostics.  My phone was always protected by an official Apple rubber case which meant it could not have been damaged until after the case was removed a few seconds before I put it in the provided box to send to them.

"Apple would not do a refund and return of product delivered to store.I went to Regent St store to collect an iMac I had ordered over Black Friday w.e. I realised I had ordered the wrong model.

Despite APPLE saying refunds and returns can be made in store.I have been waiting 60 mins on the phone now to get through to Apple to arrange a refund and collection.How is sending out a driver to collect my item in line with Apple's much lauded sustainability policy to send out an extra driver, when they could have taken my computer back today? I also could have the new computer I need. Instead I am stuck with an old one, waiting for an adviser on the phone. Very tired and upset. Manager asked me why I couldn't stick with the wrong product. When I am paying this much, I don't want to 'make do'.I chose store delivery because my last delivery experience with Apple was so bad - I waited in for three days after the due date to no avail.

However, after two dropped calls (after being on hold about 45 minutes each call) and finally getting through on the 3rd call they still are unwilling to honor their commitment.

"Apple Support Process Failure for ScamI was recently the victim of a Gift Card scam, in total I purchased 3 250 euro Apple gift cards, which were passed unwittingly to scammers. This was obviously 100% my fault. I coped on during the scam as they were trying to get me to purchase more.At this time i contacted Apple and was eventually put through to a Senior Support Agent. After a short time the agent told me that one of the cards had been redeemed and was gone but the other two he had managed to get the funds back on the card. When I queried as to whether this meant that I was safe on two of the cards (500 euros) I was told that I was.When I got back onto Apple I could not get back in touch with the initial Senior agent. The new Senior agent said she would look at the case and get back to me. After two weeks and several calls I was told that the two cards I was told were safe had actually been redeemed by the criminals and that Apple would not be able to refund me any money. Obviously I was incredulous and highlighted that Apple had 750 euros of my money obtained through criminal activities, i was told 500 euros was safe and then told that they were redeemed. I was told that the agent could raise a complaint but that i may not get a response from this. Total lack of accountability and smacks of corporate greed.

Until recently, I have never had any issues with the devices or with the Apple customer services. I have a MacBook Pro from 2015, it still works great apart from low battery life. I decided to treat myself to an upgrade and purchased the apple MacBook Pro 2022 in July. Two days ago I powered it on only to discover what appeared to be a crack on the inside of the display. The MacBook wasn't dropped, knocked, slammed or had any type of impact whatsoever. I was beside myself and made an appointment at the apple lakeside store. The technician was very helpful, he could see the MacBook was in pristine condition (apart from the faulty display) he advised the repair would go through under warranty and sent it from the store. Today I got an email from the repair centre that the damage wasn't covered and I had to pay £656!!! I called customer services and they basically refused to help, said the decision lies with the repair centre even though the written report from the tech at apple said it should have been covered. It seems that Apple have built their brand and now simply don't care, they are making these new products flimsy and carelessly and when they fail you either pay the ridiculously high fees to fix it or buy a new one. It's so disappointing because I really did love the brand.Date of experience:December 01, 2022",1,vikki clarke,1,United Kingdom,2022-12-01 00:00:00.000000,true true great low pro type technician pristine faulty warranty repair new high new disappointing,Positive

Few days ago I was looking for solutions to replace battery on my IPad Air 2 on Apple support website and after entering my model into their pre estimate questionnaire it said $129, but not final price.So I call support and agent after taking my iPad serial number, ran diagnostic and confirmed that battery needs to be replaced, cost about $100 or so. So I made an appointment and on Friday went to Apple Genius Bar.  Unfortunately, the friendly representative happily informed that Apple doesn’t replace battery, they replace the whole iPad. I said fine, works for me, it worth$100.But she said they do not have replacement, too old. And I asked why Apple website support never mentioned the age of iPad, the live agent, who run diagnostics never mentioned the age limitations. So the rep said to call Apple support again, maybe they would have a solution.I called again and Senior advisor said that neither website neither the agent who run diagnostic are in the know.  He officially took my complain , gave a case # and said, see ya.  So translation, throw the iPad to the lake.I always praised Apple customer service, but now?

"Awful productsMany members of my family, myself included, have or used to have an Apple appliance. This was a huge mistake. Apple is extremely overpriced which in some cases, that may be overlooked but the products aren't even worth purchasing. The phones, tablets, laptops etc have an old fashioned dysfunctional design and are extremely poor quality. Apple take out the basic functions for an electrical device and replace them with things that don't even work properly. They have created multiple things that require multiple sign-ins and instead of making using an electronic device easier, it makes it a genuine hassel. I really don't understand what all the hype is about and I believe that people simply purchase these products just because everyone else has them which must be what Apple relys on to carry on selling which is not the mark of a professional business.Date of experience:October 01, 2022",1,Molly,1,United Kingdom,2022-11-26 00:00:00.000000,awful huge old fashioned poor basic electrical multiple multiple electronic genuine understand mark professional,Negative

Most everything has worked seamlessly or with a bit of support.Until I purchased an iMac for my son that I thought would get him through high school. More specifically an iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, 2017). Long story short the chip with this mac had issues from the start. I spoke to over 15 Apple service specialists. They even admitted at times that their were known issues with this model and the ability to upgrade operating systems (a necessity with Apple products for safety and other reasons) crashed the system. Mojave never worked right and I was led through numerous hoops.So my son could never use his Christmas gift because it was always not booting or at the Apple store being repaired.In the end they wanted to charge me $500 and would not offer any trade in value, well, because it didn't work. It didn't work because of the bad chip choice they made when they built it!Apple is great till you have a serious issue then they throw up their hands and say too bad so sad.

"Poor customer servicePoor customer service. Took forever to finally get the iPhone 14 pro max for $2000 CDN.Once I did get it at the store, they started pressuring me to buy the Apple Care +. I said I'll decide when I get to use the phone for a few days or so.Fast forward a few days, I get the Apple Care +.A week later I decide to return the phone as I cannot get it to work for the apps that I generally use.I called Apple Customer Support for help with my apps but they were useless.It seems merit is not a prerequisite in their hiring protocols but the need to meet a certain inclusiveness.I go  back to the store to return the Iphone upon which they issue me a full refund.However when it comes to the Apple Care + refund, they told me I will have to call Apple in order to get my refund.I called Apple,  and after 2 hours of being passed about like a baseball they say they issued the refund.It took another week for the refund to clear my bank.Apple is a disaster, greedy and in the end they will fail.Follow up ....The refund that Apple issued for the actual iphone was by way of Paybright, the Company they use to finance your purchase should you decide to pay monthly for 2 years.Paybright issued the refund the next day but it took a solid week to have the refund posted back into my Credit Card. I had to call Paybright several times to ensure that a refund was coming.All the while my available credit on the Credit card was showing a debit of $2000 which I couldn't use for other purchases.All in all my experience with Apple was a nightmare, one that I will never ever repeat.Both Apple and Paybright deserve each other.My advice...If you need a cell phone buy one that is used and rock bottom cheap and change it every year or so.

"Problems with a brand new MacBook Pro 14”Bought a brand new MacBook Pro 14”, and within 3 weeks (of which only 2 was used) it has been making crackling/popping sound while playing music, and completely crashed three times in a row out of the blue and became extremely sluggish. The computer has been in a case at all times, with keyboard protection and screen protection. The only solution they give me is to hand in the computer and be without anything for at least 2-4 working days, when I can’t do that due to classes and exams. I bought a new and expensive computer to not have issues, and less than three weeks in, Apple washes its hands completely.

"Bad Experience with Apple RepairI submitted my laptop for repair after being assured it would take 3-4 days.  This was important as I was moving in two weeks.

I called Apple asking for the address the repaired laptop was sent to to be changed and was told ""the system is down, call back in a few days"".  After another few days of waiting with no updates, I called and after getting the runaround for 2 hours (!!), I finally learned that the return address could not be changed.  What a huge waste of time.  Since I would not be flying back just to pick up my laptop, I just canceled the repair.

"iPhone Notes data lostI am sharing some of my bad experience in using iPhone Notes. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1T storage since September 2001. I have been using iPhone Notes quite a while to store all my important notes such as passwords and important messages. It has been accumulated hundreds of notes over the year. It was pretty handy until a couple of days ago it suddenly disappeared! All of them! I did not do anything such as deleting or grouping etc. I was crazy about this lost as I can’t do my normal work without those Notes records. I looked up from internet to try to get some tips to retrieve them back. I’ve tried all the methods suggested without success. I realised that my notes were not stored in either of my iCloud or my outlook account because both of these accounts were full and could not take sync from my iPhone. So I think all my notes were stored locally in my iPhone. I went to a few mobile phone shops and was told there is no way to recover those lost data. I called Apple technical support and was given 3 other data recovery companies. I tried again without any success. By looking up from Internet for more information, I can see quite a few people had these problems before. But very strange that they did not talk too much after raising this issue. I summarise all my findings here:1. iPhone iOS has a bug in its Notes which can automatic remove locally stored data even you have upgrade to iOS16. Or maybe hardware storage is not stable (that may be dangerous to other data storage!)2. iPhone Notes locally stored data lost cannot be recovered by any methods.3. Apple cannot help at all and they don’t acknowledge this bug and they don’t want to take any responsibility to the data lost4. Please use iCould or your email accounts to store your Notes rather than local stored. Also make sure those accounts have space to sync your iPhone notes.Date of experience:October 18, 2022",1,Steven Shi,1,Australia,2022-10-19 00:00:00.000000,bad pro important important handy crazy normal full sync mobile technical much automatic hardware stable local sure,Positive
"$500 Apple care plan is a shamI have a macbook that I spent $500 extra for 3 year protection plan that was supposed to cover all repairs and if they couldn’t they would replace the computer. I tried to send it in for repairs and before they even got it, they tried to charge me like $200. I am furious with this company. I have an iphone and apple watch too. Bought them all in november of 2020. I will NEVER buy another Apple product again as long as I live. They are a scam company selling products that cost way more than they’re worth. They use the same factories in China that every other company uses. I will be switching to Microsoft OS and buying an msi computer next time I purchase. I either want my $500 back or my $1600 laptop repaired like the Apple care plan I paid for said. Pathetic.

The Next day i again called to Customer support, one person picked up the call. he forwarded to Genius bar Manager. again i Narrated the same story. He told me that it will be done, keep checking your mail. Since then i kept checking and now its 7th day. I bought a windows laptop. and i will never go to Mac again.

"Apples phone are not guaranteed against water damage.I've used Apple most of my adult life and just about every device I have ever bought has had some manufacturing issue.But as a designer I like Apple and I like the operating system so you end up staying with them.My most recent disaster was with my iPhone pro 11, I have just had the battery changed by Apple in Covent Garden and took it on holiday with me.While swimming I dropped it in the water but wasn't really bothered because it's waterproof and I have dropped it in water before.A day later the screen got a green line up it and was non operational to touch.I took it to the Apple Store in Covent Garden and explain the situation. They explained that it had indeed got water damage, but wasn't covered by any warranty and never was since it was only water resistant.The Italian government have already taken Apple to court over this matter and I know there is further court action happening in New York. But it's still shocking when you hear someone sat in front of you saying that your waterproof phone is only water resistant and only at 8m for 30mins.I said to the assistant that you find that statement contradictory. I also said it was clearly waterproof or water-resistant when you change the battery, to which she replied 'believe me Sir it would've been as good as the day it came out the factory if we replace the battery.' But they also said the glue they use to waterproof it weakens with time. That means 1 week I guess.Clearly this was not true since it had been in water before and never had a problem even though I had no idea that it was not waterproof but only water resistant and not covered ever by the warranty.To be honest when I bought it I don't remember it saying that it was only water resistant at eight meters for 30 seconds. But clearly Apple need to be more upfront about the water resistant claims since it contradicts the fact that they don't guarantee it and never did. It's a bit like me saying I'm a designer but I can't guarantee I can design.I assume the same is true of my Apple Watch which I swim with!!In the end the silence was too much and the Apple assistance mouth was just oddly gawping at me.It must be hard for these poor assistance to have to make excuses on behalf of their employer.So the bottom line is your phone is water resistant to x depth for X amount of time, plus it's also not advisable to take it into water because we don't guarantee it.It's really high time I left my dysfunctional relationship with Apple devices, hard as it is we can't go on.At the end of the day Apple probably have done some cost benefit analysis and decided the legal costs are worth factoring in.Date of experience:September 01, 2022",1,Ian Pickard,1,United Kingdom,2022-10-14 00:00:00.000000,recent pro waterproof screen green non operational new hear front waterproof assistant waterproof good factory glue true resistant resistant true much poor bottom resistant advisable high end legal,Positive

Wouldn’t use another brand, because none come close to apple.Regarding the negative reviews about customer support, you need to ask for a senior advisor or tech support for any issues beyond the basics.Apple has massively grown but instead of dropping support like most companies do, they are actually hiring new reps, from diverse backgrounds, some of whom are new apple users.They don’t have to offer so much support, but apple is pretty incredible. That’s why so many of us are addicted. Their products are the best available, and the company culture goes above and beyond.So there’s a good chance you’ll get one of these polite reps who are well trained but don’t know instinctively about the products like the original apple nerd support.

"My iPad Air 4 got water damage on 9/3My iPad Air 4 got water damage on 9/3. After 5 (yes that's 5, FIVE, 5) times to return it for service as it was covered by AppleCare+. I attempt 5, the ""Senior"" advisor informed me that Apple ""would not accept the return until a purchase receipt with the serial number"" is presented. Having bought it from BestBuy for delivery, the receipt had no serial number but the AppleCare+ certificate did. ""No Good!"" I was told. I took the device to a local dealer and they said they could service with no problem. Unfortunately, the last of 5 repair tickets had not been canceled so they could not submit a repair request. After 5 days and 4 calls (in addition to the over 20 calls in the prior 30 days) I finally got Apple to cancel their ticket and get the iPad repaired. I bought a Samsung Tab S8 to use while repairing the iPad. It's a better device in many ways. I bought my last Apple product with my worthless Apple Watch. I feel sad for Apple and hope the market spanks them hard.

"iPad so called “delivered” by Uber driver??!I bought an iPad to be delivered same day paying an extra $9 for the courier service.

I live in a townhouse so I know if the communal door opens. Nothing.I contact Apple and find out they sent an Uber driver for the delivery and claim it was delivered! There is no signature upon receipt, so what’s to stop the driver for just claiming it for themselves?? Apple says they’ll launch an investigation and refund me once that’s complete?!! The agent didn’t even believe me when I said I didn’t receive itHow is this an intelligent business model?

"iOS 16iOS 16, in recent years Apple’s operating system has become over complicated and confusing, it used to be a simple customer friendly interface. Now those designing it have decided more is better, and explaining how these systems work has gone from a straightforward A to B, now goes from A to Z before you get back to B.With the current iOS 16 update when sending an audio message, instead of it being at the side of the text message bar is located underneath. Once you lift your finger off of the button, your message is immediately sent and you’re unable to vet it before sending. This also means, if you happen to be sending a message to the wrong recipient you stop it. Apple have said that you can cancel from within the main body, you can’t cancel it, it won’t allow you to.I have the iPhone Mini 12 which was a replacement for the iPhone Pro 11, because I have small hands and the Pro was uncomfortable and unsafe to use. Now of course they have discontinued this model after 2 years, so much for their policies of inclusivity that doesn’t seem to cover people of small stature. They must still have the iPhone Mini carcass, so producing a small run of this size wouldn’t be difficult. But with Apple it’s all about ever increasing profits, and customer satisfaction is now secondary.Since the update to iOS 16 I’ve encountered multiple issues none of which have been resolved:1. Apps too big for the screen, unable to locate the buttons at the bottom of the screen.2. Between 7/11 thousand photos missing from iCloud pre dating 2015.3. The map app missing, I have to swipe from the left of the screen.4. When turning on location and searching in the Apple maps, it’s unable to find my location and sends me to Germany or France when I’m in neither country.5. The complicated way for « ne pas déranger » prior to iOS 16 update and all of the complicated privacy settings.6. The batterie drains really quickly now, I have to charge it about 3 times a day.7. It’s also overheating and I’ve burnt my had several times, it’s also burnt my leg through my pantaloons.I have contacted Apple several times through their online chat, reporting all of these problems but no one has been able to solve any of the issues.All of the above issues have been reoccurring since the 12 September 2022 iOS 16 update.Date of experience:September 12, 2022",31,Markus Rafael Lombard,2,United Kingdom,2022-10-04 00:00:00.000000,recent used simple friendly current audio side text underneath unable wrong recipient main cancel allow small uncomfortable unsafe much cover small small difficult update big unable unable ne prior several several able,Negative

"Dissatisfied with AppleHonestly, i was very happy with all my apple products. I had bought a laptop back in 2017 and almost immediately had keyboard issues. Thinking maybe it was because of me (even though i take very good care of my electronics) i knew i didn’t have enough money to get it fixed. Over the years i tried so many things to help with this issue. Frequent cleaning, turning on and off sticky keys, trying to find a solution. I never received any information from apple saying there was a model malfunction. so i went on believing the issue was my own. It wasn’t until years later that i found out through a video online that it in fact was a company error. I never received and notifications letting me know the models were faulty. And now i am experiencing a situation where i will have to pay to fix a problem that is a malfunction not of my own. As someone who owns all apple products it’s very disheartening to know that they don’t really care to help their customers with problems that they create.

When I rang I was told they do not have enough date on me (I used to have Apple products from iPhone to Mac Pro but chose to switch to Samsung), hence I have to wait to reset my password. In this age and date one would think it is much easier to deal with anything, a question to Apple is, how much more data will you have for me on 7 October if you did not have enough now in order to re set my password. Imagine if  I was in need of  more complex issue!!! With such behaviour they put me off to purchase their new IPhone 14 pro and IPad, instead I will opt for Samsung 22 and 23 later on. They have way much better customer service and certainly do not need 3 weeks to re set password. Especially if they check your identity via your phone and email at the same time. Insane. When Steve Jobs left the company over the issue with their then management, the Apple went down. It is the same issue now.

"This company is a jokeWhy on earth would a reputable company use Uber OF ALL THINGS to deliver packages for them? They make you select a window for a delivery because you have to sign for the package. But UBER never shows up and so you wait all day for a driver that never delivers your package. They can't offer you a refund because you would have to send the item back personally. ITS STILL AT THE STORE. and then Only to be told that they can't cancel your order because they have to do a shipping investigation to figure out what happened to the package, even though it's STILL AT THE STORE (which would have taken me an hr there and back to get it) and they don't communicate with their own people. I know this for a fact because throughout the entire day I spoke with 5 different people who had no idea what was going on. Half of those correspondence through text WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE RECORD OF because I sure did. It was just an utter joke.

"25 years of business over due to Apple greedinessI’ve had Apple technology for a long time. I started with a Power Mac G5, which was robust and fast, it still works but is used now as a giant storage device. The cracks in Apple began to appear when they refused to support older tech like this, but I carried on with them because of the quality in customer service and cutting edge technology. I know how to take iPhones apart and fix them up etc. So, my list of mostly obsolete Apple products is: G5, MacBook Air Pro, iPhones 3,4,5,6 iPads x 2. 100gb cloud storage. That’s a lot of money spent in the past 25 years. I could put all of that towards a deposit on a house!So I recently discovered an ongoing payment to Apple for their music service. I don’t do subscription stuff like this, there’s not enough good music and I don’t have the time for it anyway. I spent a total of 7.5 hours trying to reclaim around £200 of unexpected fees, back and forth between Apple (who confirmed I could neither subscribe to or use this service and acknowledged I had never accessed it as my devices are no longer supported and therefore unable) and my mobile contract provider 3mobile (who had taken the payments for Apple) they’ve ripped me off for this petty amount of unauthorised subscription fees. I’m done. I can’t wait for my Fair Phone 4. I’m never going to buy or recommend Apple products again. iCloud storage is getting transferred and cancelled. Customer services isn’t what it used to be, products don’t work as intended (cloud doesn’t work properly, blue tooth is rubbish etc) Siri is a pain in the bum. 25 years of loyalty to Apple and 10 years with 3mobile over because they want to keep that extra £200... well, no more of that. My next devices are going to be Fair Phone 4 and I’m going to stick with building my own PC’s and running them on Linux.I’m also going to campaign for the prevention of sales of products that will not be supported before the end of life use expires.

"Apple delaying warranty claim on not fit for purpose phoneHi. My 10 month old Apple SE battery suddely went from being OK to not lasting 6 hours. It happened overnight.  It is under warranty. It spent a week with apple agents.  Agents have said it is not software, not battery and  unusual. Apple agree it is not right but all Apple do is insist they perform more tests. We are now 2 weeks on and they have run the same diagnostics over and over. Asked the same questions every call. Telling me there are more diagnostices to run.It passes all their tests, but discharges 10% each hour whislt sitting on a desk.I have to pay the £42 costs for the initial inspection where they tell me something is wrong and it is unusual.Now I have to wait another week for them to take a look at the next set of tests. So three weeks of looking at my phone to see if they can replace it, never once suggesting it is working as it should. I am told there is yet another set of diagnosis at the end of the three weeks. Almost 10% of the phones life spent in apples remediation process..... no obvious outcome yet.So far over 4 hours on the phone, several hours more in the repair shop, a new phone costs Apple less than this if you charged out the time.So be warned, when you buy an i phone it should state clearly the battery life is expected to be under 8 hours within a year. Their telephone after sales service is non existant (lots of lovely people who cannot do anything). Their warranty is rendered inoperable for the burocracy.It all adds up to a major issue with the description of the goods under the sale of goods act in the UK.Escalated from tier one to tier two who tell me they have the authority to order a replacement. However they dont because the Engineers have the authority. Weird.We went to a Genius Bar ... they told us there ws nothing wrong, but we were very determined.The replacement phone lasts 5 to 6 times as long as the old one. Still Apple refuse to believe there was anything wrong with the old phone.

I bought a new mac with AppleCare, an Apple Watch 7 and i pre-ordered a new iPhone 14 Pro just this morning.  I also own a macbook, AppleTV and iPad and airpod Pros which i bought earlier this year.  I also have older airpods.  I subscribe to Apple Fitness, Apple Music and Apple Cloud.  I work for a marketing agency and asked them upon hire to send me a macbook because I haven't used Windows in years and it would slow me down.Ya think that would carry a little weight???  Ya think that given how much I have invested in the Apple brand that when 3 weeks after I receive my AppleWatch, they announce a newer model and I want to exchange my brand new watch for it, they would grant me some wiggle room?  I mean they have a 2 week return for any reason policy but i missed it by 4 days... FOUR DAYS.  I called Apple got bounced around for an hour and was told by 2 people to trade it in meaning my brand new $500 watch would be worth $300 because of those 4 days.Wow.Steve Jobs may have been an a-hole but at least his Apple took care of the loyalists and wasn't as petty as Tim Cook's Apple.My request is in no way unreasonable but It does make me ask myself why I am loyal to a company that is not loyal to me.Great products overshadowed by terrible support and lack of loyalty to their hardcore base.Date of experience:September 09, 2022",9,StrangeAsAngels,2,United States,2022-09-10 00:00:00.000000,downhill last new new pro little weight new wiggle new petty unreasonable ask loyal terrible,Positive
"Stone age at AppleI pre-ordered the new iPhone 14. Checkout process went through. I applied 2 $100 gift cards I had got last month and that I had never used. All went through and I got my order confirmed. However, after a few hours, looking at my order status on their website, it said ""on hold - waiting for payment"". I sure could see my full charge on my credit card and that my gift cards were fully depleted too, as expected. Called a first agent who told me nothing to worry they still see my order processing and no issue. Called a second agent who could see something wrong with one of the gift cards not registering and they submitted a case with their payment team which could take up to 4 days to be resolved. Called a third agent who told me I didn't pay enough so charged me another $35 or so on my card. Called a fourth time and got an agent a little more knowledgeable who saw the issue too, tried to fix it without success but at least initiated the refund to my credit card for the overcharge. However, they also needed to submit a case with their payment team there which could take a few days. Bet I won't get my iPhone by Sep 16 but keeping my fingers crossed. Their backend system is from like in the stone age, in total contrast with their image. Their customer support agents are either not digging to the bottom of the issues (agent #1 and #3) and/or just not enabled enough (Agent #2 and #4).

"Apple he let our business down for the last time!Two reasons why we will not be using Apple and changing her 24 phones to android.There is no point in being contactable more than the competition when your customer support is inferior.Firstly I contacted Apple to find which was the most up-to-date Apple phone I could buy secondhand which would have the most updates and they advise me to buy an Apple 11 pro Max iPhone.The person I talked to was incompetent and told me to buy a phone which was the last Apple phone ever made which would not receive 5G.I don’t understand why people like Apple employ untrained ignorant people on the front line who are going to cost th5m the business by giving out disinformation.Also. Every time there is an Apple update I have to do Apple‘s job for them, find the new relevant bug, and sort it out myself because Apple are incapable of doing so, cause more issues with the new updates than they tend to alleviate.Why is it that customers are not told when there are updates and their phone stopped working with products from the App Store when, if only the customers could be told that their phones need updating, there would be no problem?You reach out to customer support at Apple, they give you bad information and you end up with an inferior product because they employ people who they do not train and who are ignorant costing us business customers in conscionable amounts of money.I’ve now invested in an iPhone 11 Pro Max on the advice of Apple only to find that my provider is putting lots of new masts in my town with 5G and that my phone cannot receive it after asking Apple’s advice on what phone to buy.Is it any wonder that android shares are going up and Apple shares are going down?I’m tired of doing the job of Apple because I can’t maintain the system and I’m tired of talking to plonkers.“For sale “. 24 Apple iPhones are various different models and, “wanted “24 new android phones which cost much less & will do 5G.Another multi level business customer lost through incompetent uncaring.Date of experience:September 07, 2022",1,Ted Eyers,1,United Kingdom,2022-09-07 00:00:00.000000,last pro last understand ignorant front update new relevant incapable new bad inferior ignorant conscionable pro new tired various different new incompetent,Negative

"Apple is immoral with scamming customer supportMy iPhone 7 no longer gets service after the update.  I went into Apple to most likely buy a new phone.  Many Apple 7 and 8 customers were in there with the same issue and then we find out by another customer (confirmed by a staff) that the next iPhone 14 will be released in 4 days. I was told they could do a temporary fix 2 hours later.  That got bumped to 2:45, which I was not told was possible.  No fix, but a push to buy a 13 (which will go down in price 4 days from now).  They said the update does not affect software, but sometimes puts ‘stress’ on hardware.  In other words, they now program it it fizzle your wires.  They are an immoral company doing ‘updates’ to make products obsolete to push out stock before a new phone.  Many geniuses looked like they were just walking around looking busy, going into the back often. Our government is not managing monopolies.

"2019 iMac 27” stolen from Apple authorized resellerOn June 7th, 2022, I called Apple support regarding my iMac 27"" computer.  It seemed like it had a hard drive failure and the apple operator made an appointment for me to take it into their Apple authorized reseller store Simply Mac at the Avenues in Marrietta, GA.  It was supposed to take 3 to 4 days to diagnose the problem then let me know what the repair would entail.  I tried to call the store on June 10th to get an update, but I got a recording that they were busy and to leave a message.  The same thing happened on June 11th so I drove to the store that day.  It turns out that the Simply Mac store had gone out of business and June 9th and no one called me to notify me to pick up my computer.  The rental office of the mall could not open the shop for me to retrieve my computer because the Simply Mac had filed for bankruptcy and it was in litigation.  The rental office gave me the number of the bankruptcy attorney in Salt Lake City.  I called him and he tried to help but said he was being ghosted by Apple and the landlord.  I have made repeated calls to Apple support since June 11th and they could only say that I should wait for an email from Apple.  I kept calling Apple, the mall rental office  and the attorney every two weeks because I nevery received an update regarding my iMac.I finally I received a call from Apple support today August 24th, 2022 telling me that the representative/partner who emptied the store cannot locate my computer.  So basically, my computer has been stolen from a store that was recommended to me by Apple Support.  The apple agent who emptied the store, will not return my calls or answer my emails.

"Apple are not Unreliable and Not…Apple are not Unreliable and Not Trustworthy, Poor customer support, not Knowledgeable, not Attentive, Not Helpful. All they want is to sell their products but not resolving the issue. I have wasting time on phone calls, travel to Apple store in Kingston Upon Thames for repairs twice to get my IPad Air repair but issues was not resolved, called again and they arranged another appointment and problems didn't resolve. Tech said nothing wrong with my iPad Air and restored to Factory setting and said should work fine. While he tried doing for me the setting and he said the screen is frozen instead of resolving the issue and Apple tech asked me to trade in for £80 and buy a new iPad.My iPad crashes many times but they can't fix the problem.

"Huge Disappointment with Apple ProductOwner of iphone 12 pro max - 1.6 years, 256 GB of data.- error code 1110 – NO WARNINGS!Today My iPhone 12 pro max is stuck in an endless Apple loop. I tried a hard reboot. That didn't work. Then I tried to update it in restore mode. I contacted apple support 3 times, got 3 different cases opened, Case: 101782281721 Case: 101782285715, Case: 101782348089. They don’t mention nothing about these known issues, and it seems that they have a permanent fix solution already in places for new software’s updates helping with error code 1110 – full hard disk and memory usage.After experiencing this issue and seeing the Apple recommended solution to basically reset your phone, I have been disappointing and shocked. I will never buy apple product in my life. ‘Trust’ was the only word in my mind every time a bought apple product.Apple can make nice products, but they can't seem to provide a fix for the device storage getting full issue.I hope for other's sake Apple (1) directly address the storage getting full issue to prevent it happening - e.g. lots of warnings at >95% full and at 97% full must delete stuff and cannot take more photos, (2) provide a proper fix for error 1110 and (3) provide a simple phone recovery environment to allow people to backup their data and/or delete unnecessary apps to free up spaceI lost 239 GB of data in principal pictures with my little daughter 7 years old, moment in my life and her spent in the last 2 years.

"Worst customer service - worst companyCase: 101781446532  Honestly, I was such a fan of Apple for 15 years. Now I am definitely switching. Seriously, I have never been treated so bad. Apple used to be the best company - what happened to you guys?? My iPhone 13 pro is 10 months old, still under Apple warranty yet the side button doesn’t work and has many other issues. Clearly hardware issue, clearly replacement needed. But no, they try to brush it off! They used to be so helpful, even the support online. Now it’s a bunch of useless people who don’t care.Also, I was 5’ late for my appointment today at Regent St Apple Store BECAUSE of their own queue and they did not care and didn’t let me to my appointment although I was on time at the store!! Really disgusting and horrible customer care, I was with my infant and tried to reason with them so I can see a specialist today because the iPhone doesn’t lock - side button broken and they just said sorry wait for 2h although again it was THEIR fault. Apple- get back to 5-10 years ago when you treated your customer with respect! Lost meTo add: senior advisor called me, advised that I can get the faulty phone replace my at covent garden store, went there, spent another 2h and £60 for taxi just to be told arrogantly by Anne-Marie (covent garden manager) they would not replace it and only Apple support can do that.

"Apple employees are used car salesman!On Saturday, August 20th I walked into the Apple store inside Summit Place Mall, Troy, Michigan.I only wanted a technician in Apple to unlock my phone.  Instead, I ended up with a salesman named Matt.  He claimed he wasn't a salesman, but the first words that popped out of his mouth after seeing my iPhone 6s was ""WOW! An antique!""  Then he went into a spiel about how he doesn't work on commission, but how it would only cost me $429.00 to upgrade to an iPhone SE. He tried to patronize me asking what I did for a living, etc.  Then another employee joined in and again remarked ""Oh! An antique!"", and proceeded to try to sell me the iPhone SE. The other employee reminded me that none of Apple's employees work on commission but were only there to help me.Then I met another employee who also reminded me that I had an old phone, and that the iPhone SE was much faster. He tried to patronize me complimenting me on my watch.  Finally, just to get the Hell out of there I agreed to buy the phone They'd really hammered me to buy the phone.When I entered the store, I left my friend who's suffering from dementia in the car.  I had no idea i would spend all that time when all I wanted was to unblock my apple account.  I finally told them I had to leave!  When I got to the parking garage my friend wasn't in the car!  I wondered around until I finally found him way outside the garage.  Yesterday I returned the phone.  Today someone from Apple unlocked my Apple/ iTunes account.  I researched Apple's sales training program; and they DO in fact encourage their employees to hammer the customers because (hopefully) the employee will get a promotion in the company.  The employees are a JOKE!   They're caricatures of the old used car salesman wearing a checkerboard sport jacket and loud tie.  I liken them to mosquitoes on a muggy summer night!

"One of the worst companies for service…One of the worst companies for service and customer care, In my opinion fraudulent and opportunistic out there to exploit customers.I have an ipad that works perfectly but could not charge due to a problem with the USB port , an item that sells around £20 as spare.Apple Genious bar in Brent Cross Shopping Center told me that they dont fix ipads and proposed as the only solution to exchange my ipad for a refurbished one and pay £550 for the pleasure...A price that is only marginally less than the retail refurbished price.Lets mention here that they described the refurbished ipad as NEW .... only after a lot of proding and seeing the brown box they admitted it was refurbished..My daughter has an apple pencil she never used for 3 years so she gave it to me, it is as new but when I placed it on my ipad would not charge !The unused item battery packed in after 3 years!Apple support solution is to replace it for £3 less than buying a new one from the apple store... you cannot make this stuff up.If you find this service acceptable then Apple products are for you .Update in regards to the ipad : Took it to covent Garden Apple store and it was fixed on the spot, it was a software issue apparently, yeap the difference between £550 and £0 is to go to a better apple store, I would avoid the brent cross one.Apple seems to be on a crusade to get as much money as it can rather than provide an honest service to their very expensive 'made in china' products.It used to be a much different company.Date of experience:August 20, 2022",1,RedFerrari7777,1,United Kingdom,2022-08-26 00:00:00.000000,fraudulent opportunistic due dont retail new brown new unused new acceptable covent spot much expensive much different,Positive

"Apple total disgrace to humanityOrdered a MacBook Air on July 14th and was given a delivery date of between 5th and 12th August. As I was doing photo editing for a Photo Exhibition for Children's Cancer I wasn't too concerned as I had my iPad Pro. Then last week it packed up so I rang Apple to ask if my MacBook could be got to me any quicker due to the fact of the Children's Cancer. I was told by the lady I spoke to that she would put in an Urgent request to her box to get me my MacBook. That never happened either she never pass it on or Apple couldn't be bothered. So yesterday the 9th they dispatched my MacBook by DHL, it arrived at my local depot this morning the 10th at 0733 but DHL won't deliver it until Thursday 11th WHY!! I've no idea. I rang Apple to be told they can't do anything to help me as it was with the courier and they do what they want. I asked if they could ring DHL but they refused, Apple just don't care not only about their customers but also Children who have Cancer. They could have least had the decency to speed up the delivery of my MacBook considering the circumstances for what I was using it for, they are a total disgrace I just hope none of their children get cancer, they are a disgrace to humanity.Date of experience:August 10, 2022",76,Alan Smyth,1,United Kingdom,2022-08-10 00:00:00.000000,total last due lady urgent local decency total,Negative

"Tried to buy a new apple phoneTried to buy a new apple phone, and I was told to check everyday until I see stock or change the type I want, as I cannot get delivery to my home, as we have nothing but break ins in our community mailboxes and thefts at our front door (all those dang amazon shoppers and courier stuff going on - it would make sense that thieves would start taking stuff from door steps).The sales customer rep, wasn't able to provide any information regarding stock, as it is either available or not, they have no idea what's being delivered each day.  Anyway when I asked how long I have to look for, and if it could be as long as 6 months to have to check every day, he said yes.So now, I would have to check every day for as long as it takes.This is an IT company who should be able to have great logistics and easily meet their customer needs through those logistics.  I'm going to be part of the change and get better customer service elsewhere with a different product, NOT Through apple for my cell phone. Why wouldn't they simply allow us to pay and ship to a store.

"Bad customerservice and more bad organisationNever buy apple products anymore!! this company says they are helping you with customersservice and try to be kind, but at the end of the day they dont help you, the only thing what they do is picking your money with the expensive products.I go for Samsung, allready have tv and next phones are from them too, synchronising and everything more easy, and good quality.Apple dont even deserve 1 star, if I could choose 0 stars, that was better option.How it started: I planned my holiday and want to upgrade, from 11 to iphone 13, better pictures etc... nice for the holiday. On apple. com /nl the dutch apple website stayed today ordered, tomorrow at home. I thought I go for real quality, not a reseller like Coolblue, just direct at Apple, for the trust and that I can swap in my previous Iphone 11.Next day I got an email and I could follow the package, it was strange because my package with the Iphone 13 went from Eindhoven Netherlands to Brussel Belgium. And more strange that the package was on hold the next day. So I called Apple and they search it out and said, we dont know whats happen and we will do a research, this will take maximum 10 days. But I had no time to wait bcs of my holiday I should go. So I came with the solution, I go now by car 1 hour go and 1 hour return to Amsterdam Apple store and grab it there. No that was not possible, I can go to the Apple store but should paid that one too, and the other one I needed to wait till the research it was done and after that I shoul get money back. I went to the apple store and bought the 13, now I was just on time to go on holiday.In the meanwhile I got per post the paper cover to put my old Iphone in and send it to swap in.The employee from apple. com/ nl told me I should cancel my order and than I got automatically my money back, so I did do.When I was on holiday I received an email that the swap in should be canceled, if the Iphone 11 was already at the location it should be send back.I called again to say that they can keep and i want the money for the swap in 290 euro.No it goes by an external company, likewize. They couldnt call or email them because they have no phone number and not even an email program, are they lying or is this a strange community? Never met administration people without an emailadress..... So I should take contact and arrange everything by myself.After I came home from holiday the iphone 11 were sended back indeed. The good thing was I got the money back from the Iphone 13 i ordered. But now I had an Iphone 11 and I dont want to sell it at internet, that was the reason I did choose the swapp in/ trade in from apple. Now the woman told me that the apple store said things what was not true and appologize many times, I told her to search a solution and not think following the script, but I only hear her talking like a robot, and ask for a big discount than, the next time I buy I can get a small present, like a cable or Iphone cover.... they really dont listen, I asked to discus with her manager.... not possible.Online because I was 2 weeks later back from holiday my phone was now worth 270, 25 euro less, and they even dont want to pay for it. While the whole mistake is from apple.25 euro is offcourse for them nothing. For me its a principe to, what a way how you treat your customers... The whole conversation was really bad, I feel like in a factory, like a number, not a client.They should do this: Sorry sir, ok here is a voucher for 25 euro, show me or prove that your iphone is less worth now and you get it. You can spend it on apple products.Than I said I want to complain about this customer service. She told me its only possible by sending a letter to apple in Ireland.... When you pay or when they need money or sell it all goes over internet, ones you complain send a letter to Ireland.... this is the way how they work... to build a wall and hope nobody will do. Why not: complaints at apple.com?They need to change their whole attitude!I got more angry and angry while the talk goes further.I didnt want to send a review. because I never do and dont want to waste my time. But at the moment Im still busy to sell my iphone 11 by the company Likewize what they send. Im afraid I need to go to the apple store again.....so much time wasting and loosed only because the **** customerservice from apple and all their internall rules, reallly not helpfull!!Think out of the box and with the client!

"This is a testimony to how I was…This is a testimony to how I was treated by Apple Support Portugal.Around 2018 I purchased a Macbook Pro 15 via Amazon and before the one year mark was up, I decided to purchase Apple Care + (3 extra years of support) just in case. When I received my invoice, though, I noticed the support date ended two years from the purchase date - not the 3 years I had been told via phone.This was when my ordeal began.I went to the support site and tried calling them, and after waiting for several minutes and the call not being picked up, it got disconnected. Strangely enough, when my intention was to make a purchase, customer support not only answered my calls immediately, but they even called me back within 5 minutes.I scheduled a support call (mind you, this was right after the purchase) and on my chosen date, I got no call.Fast forward a few months and numerous attempts to contact support again, and I still had no luck.One year later, after many failed calls and being blatantly ignored (scheduled calls, attempted calls from my part) I decided to contact US support. I got an immediate reply via chat, however, wrong country, so no one could answer why my Apple Care + was 2 years instead of 3. Great.On 2021, the 2 year extra support ends and lo and behold, my touchbar decides to stop working.After a few more attempts to contact or being contacted by Apple Portugal, I contact US support and a few troubleshooting steps later, the technician concludes with 100% certainty that my touchbar has to be replaced... Not only that, but since the replacement is out of warranty, it would cost me $1475 because the whole upper part of my latop had to be replaced - much like the keyboard replacement program.Again: my ""not 3 year"" Apple Care+ had just ended, like, 20 days prior to this. Murphy's Law at its best...I ask if I can send it to be repaired under the keyboard replacement program, but no ""the device has to have proven keyboard issues to be repaired under that program"", which made me seriously consider shoving dirt under the keys just to cause an issue with the keyboard and have it repaired for free.At this point, I'm basically being punished for not having keyboard issues.However, once again, US service cannot help me any further because again: wrong country.I decide to live with a broken touchbar. It still worked, I just couldn't see half of it and had to pretty much guess what I was pressing. I wasn't going to invest 1500 bucks on a 2500 computer that I was still paying (loan).This was last month: I decided to reset the Macbook and upgrade it to Monterey and the touchbar issue resolved itself.Thank you Apple for the $1500 quote on a software issue.And thank you Apple Portugal for simply ignoring my existence (I have process numbers and proof of everything that happened).Anyway I hope my experience helps anyone who had/has issues with Apple, and particularly tech issues the touchbar on the A1990 2018 Macbook Pro and was told it would need to be repaired. Also it should serve as an eye-opener to Apple so they address the huge customer service problem here in Portugal.PS - I tried making a formal complaint in Apple forums and here's their reply, after removing my post. Apparently censorship and silencing customers who have issues is considered good business practice:""We removed your post Awful customer support in Portugal - Issue with touchbar because it contained rants or complaints that weren’t constructive. We understand wanting to share experiences, but these forums are meant for technical questions that can be answered by the community.""I personally believe a non working touchbar that started working after an update qualifies as a tech problem... But it also means less money for Apple, right? So let's pretend that it's an hardware issue and charge people 1500 bucks for a replacement that doesn't solve anything. And by the way, let's not let anyone be made aware that it's a software issue...Never again...Date of experience:July 31, 2022",6,Maria Barroso,1,Portugal,2022-07-31 00:00:00.000000,extra ordeal several enough right numerous many immediate wrong extra stop technician whole upper much like ask keyboard wrong half much invest last upgrade existence tech pro huge formal censorship good awful constructive meant technical update right hardware aware,Positive

"Apple Watch Never Charged: Apple won’t replace it!Defective Apple Watch: Apple blocks all new reviews on Apple.com and Google Maps!My family bought a 2017 Apple Watch, valued at $399… and then proceeded to misplace it. This Summer, five years later, I found it behind the bookcase… and was thrilled… until I tried to use it. The watch would neither charge nor turn on.I went in person to the Apple store, told the employee my problem, and was assured that, if I made an appointment with their “Genius Bar,” they WOULD help me…. And was told to “get there early.“ I wait another week for my appointment, and go back to the Apple store again, early as instructed… only to find THEM running late.A half an hour later, the so-called “Genius” asks if I’ve tried to charge it. I assure him I did, but it does not charge. He plugs in his own charger and confirms I am correct. Then, he proceeds to tell me my only option is to pay them $200 more to send my BRAND NEW, NEVER USED APPLE WATCH for repairs! “Why did an Apple employee waste my Time by having me  make an appointment with you,” I asked him. He replied, “I don’t know!,” seeming as frustrated as me. “I don’t know what you want from me,“ he continued, “There’s nothing I can do for you.”We already paid $400 for their Apple Watch and they have no proof it ever worked at all. Next, the Apple “Genius“ blames me for the watch problem because I didn’t start the watch for five years. Both the Apple employees told me Apple watches won’t work if you don’t start them for a “long period”… but couldn’t say what amount of time that meant. $400 for a watch that stops working if you don’t use it for an undefined period? $400 for a Watch that we have no proof ever worked.THE DEAL: These Apple employees had almost no customer service skills and  absolutely no empathy.

"HORRIBLE SERVICEHORRIBLE SERVICE! I have ordered iPhone 13 Pro on 18th of July through apple official website.

"A glorious FUBAR by APPLE and UPSAt 2:21 PM on Thursday July 21 I ordered a 128GB iPhone 13 mini for my wife from Apple. It was in stock and it was supposed to be delivered on the following day, Friday, July 22. UPS picked it up from Apple in Chicago on Friday at 9:22 AM. We live in downtown Chicago. You'd think it would be an easy delivery, no? Well, you'd be wrong.We didn't get it on Friday. Apple did collect the $923.56 from my wife on Saturday. But we didn't get the phone on Saturday or Sunday either.On Monday July 25 I checked our order status at the Apple Store online. It said: ""Shipment on hold. There is an issue with your delivery and the carrier is unable to deliver your package. Please contact us at 1-800-MY-APPLE."" Come again??? We live in downtown Chicago, about 1.4 miles from the Michigan Avenue Apple Store. We get deliveries from UPS all the time. There's a doorman in our lobby twenty-four hours seven days a week. But UPS is unable to deliver our package? That's very interesting. What happened? We'd love to know more.We checked the UPS website. They had updated their tracking information. It said they'd deliver the package by 7:00 PM that evening. We waited till past 7:00 PM. They didn't. We called Apple. There was a nice lady who looked into it for us. She took a lot of notes. She said they had no idea what was going on. They would start an investigation. But we should call UPS, too. We called UPS. It took about twenty minutes before we managed to get past the automatic dragon lady who won't let you talk to a human being unless you have a magic key. We spoke to a nice lady who looked into it for us. She said they couldn't tell us anything. We weren't the shipper. They can only talk to the shipper. We should ask Apple to start an investigation. We told her we already had. She said we should be patient.On Tuesday July 26 we called Apple again. We spoke to a nice man. He looked into it for us. He read all of the notes and took some more notes. He said he saw the problem. But he had no updates. We should be  patient. They have a process. It needs to run its course. We would hear from them no later than two days after they started the investigation. We didn't.Today it's Thursday July 28, a week since we placed the order, six days since it was shipped, five days since our money was collected. We still haven't heard from Apple. But UPS did update their tracking information a while ago. It says that ""the delivery date will be provided as soon as possible."" Apparently it wasn't possible on Tuesday. It wasn't possible on Wednesday either. Apparently it's still not possible today.Can you believe it? We paid more than $900 for an Apple iPhone that was supposed to arrive six days ago. It must be somewhere in Chicago don't you think? But where? When will we get it? Apple isn't able to locate it? Can't track it with some global-corporate equivalent of the ""FindMy"" app technology that works so well to track my son and my wife? UPS can't locate it either? Somebody doesn't know how to scan a bar code? The dog ate the paper? The driver got sick? ""It fell off the truck""?I guess it serves us right for trusting Apple and UPS that $923.56 would be enough to make them do their job. We should have walked to the Apple Store and picked it up in person. It's only half an hour walk away. But we got Covid ten days ago. We're still recovering. We ought to be patient. So we're whiling away our time on the web and on the phone. We ought to get paid for this! It's hard work.Like I said: FUBAR!P.S. In case anybody cares: I bought my first Mac in 1985. Or was it 1984?

"Apple’s support is unnecessarily complicatedApple makes getting customer support unnecessarily complicated - whether in a store, using the chat facility or by phone. Every interaction seems to need an appointment.I recently bought a duo charger and it was faulty. Returning it to my local store, I needed an appointment, so I waited around.Despite having another product on the shelf, I would have to wait for my replacement product to be delivered to the store - and to make another visit. It just didn’t make sense.Notified some days later of my item bring ready for collection, I returned to the store and completed the exchange.What the store failed to tell me was that inside the sealed box was only a replacement charger. Had they have told me, I would’ve kept my USB-C cable and instruction manual.But since they didn’t tell me and this wasn’t realised until I got home, I again had to reach out to Apple.Initially using the text chat facility, I was told I would need to make an appointment to be contacted by phone. Really?!That call achieved little. The member of staff didn’t grasp the problem and simply transferred my call - cold - to my local store.Needless to say, it meant ANOTHER visit to the Apple store.

"Apple “warranty” is a myth!My 9-month old iWatch Series 6 (GPS and Cellular) suddenly went dark. It still “worked”: I would get notifications and alarms, etc. - but there was no display at all.I took it to the local Apple Store where the tech verified my issue, went through the steps to turn off the Activation Lock, then sent it in to Apple Repair. Apple Repair sent it back without even looking at it because they said the Activation Lock was still enabled - but didn’t tell me how to disable it or what to do with it after I did! I called support and the tech walked me through the exact same steps I’d already done at the Apple Store then was at a loss and had to escalate it to a senior tech. 35 minutes later I finally got the Activation Lock removed. Mind you, it was all done on my phone so my watch didn’t need to be returned to me except as punishment!I sent the watch back for repair and was told there was a puncture in my microphone mesh which voided my warranty so I’d have to pay $399.00 to fix it.  I said I don’t know how the microphone was damaged but that had nothing to do with my display not working so could they just fix that??  Nope.  The “accidental damage” to the microphone voided the warranty so it was $399.00 or nothing would be done.  I refused to pay another $400 for a watch that cost $600 originally and was less than a year old - so they sent it back to me broken.I tried taking it to a 3rd party retailer for repair but they said they’d have to send it to the same Apple warehouse for repair… and in fact, now that I’d turned down their original offer, it’d cost an additional $100 for a “diagnostic fee” and it’d be $499.

"Loyal customer treated shabbilyI ordered 2 iPhone 12's and the REQUIRED new charger for each at the same time.  I received one phone 3 business days later (after being told they would ship out the same day and I would get the phones next business day). The other phone and the 2 chargers arrived the next day.  I tried to set up the first iPhone the day I got the other phone and chargers, which was a week ago today.  I spent over 8 hours on the phone and in chats with Apple and Verizon.  Each one of them said the inability to set up the phone was the fault of the other vendor.  At about 1:30 am the following day, Apple agreed that the phone was the problem and I should return it.  They sent a return label and I sent it back via Fed-ex that same morning.  The customer service rep assured me that when Apple got the phone back they would send out a new phone the same day.  They got the phone yesterday and still cannot tell me when it will ship.  Also, they said it may be up to a week before I can get it.... but to keep watching my email.  I have been an Apple customer for over 15 years and this is how loyal customers get treated.  I once had a similar problem with an iPhone I got from Verizon...  Once Verizon determined the phone was a problem, they promptly sent me a new phone and I was allowed to return the defective phone in the box in which I received the new phone.

"DPD steal Apple products during delivery and Apple make customers liableI ordered an iPhone 13 Pro after getting an email from Apple to state that I could get money off the phone if I traded in my current iPhone X , also I could get it 0% interest free credit as they have a loan partnership agreement with Barclays.The phone was due the next morning, buzzer goes I buzz the delivery driver into my building and I hear him come in, I go downstairs to meet him and he’s not there but the box is on the floor, I pick it up , it’s totally empty . Either the driver stole the phone or or was stolen at the DPD depot . Long story short I reported it immediately to Apple to tell them that the phone was not delivered just an empty box and to point out that on their email it says that customers will have to sign for deliveries. Even though that policy was not followed Apple have closed the case. The only thing they were interested in was getting the police crime reference number I assume so they can claim on their insurance. I am left paying a £900 loan to Barclays for a phone that doesn’t exist . The appalling thing is they are a tech company they can see that my data has not transferred over to the new phone because I don’t have it !!!! I’ve been an Apple customer for over 20 years.

"Buy Apple, Be bullied legallyI have been using iPhone, iPad MacBook for over 12yrs. Last October I bought my new iPhone 13pr, iPad Pro , Apple Pencil and AirPods online. As all my data was transferred from my old iPhone and I chose dark mode to protect my eyes, I did not notice there is a faulty pixel on my iPhone 13pro at the top left corner. It’s very difficult to notice because of the black margin of Apple screen. Lately when I change to the light mode, I see it and call Apple service to seek for the replacement as I am still in warranty. But the customer service ask me to diagnose it with a technician appointed by them. I have to drive one hour to go to the service store, but they can not diagnose it only if I leave this phone to them two days. I would not like to leave my phone cuz I will have no phone to use and I will have to drive back to get it, and the technician guy said they might only change the screen after open and check the phone.My iPhone is working well and brand new condition but with a small faulty black pixel on, I do not need more damage to the phone merely because it has a faulty pixel. So I called Apple service again to tell them the issue and ask for direct replacement because I did nothing wrong for this faulty product from them. They admit this faulty pixel might caused by the faulty hardware, or it might be caused by the software. Neither of the reasons was my fault, but according to their terms if I purchased an Apple product, I need to suffer all these troubles their faulty product caused. They will not replace it if I do not drive to the service store several time and let them open my iphone so them can find out what caused the faulty pixel even if I did not misuse.Apple causes so many troubles for customers to give up seeking for their right to get a good product in warranty time. I do not wanna to risk to get a broken phone after I got a faulty product. I will keep this faulty black pixel on my phone screen as a reminder of the terrible customer service from Apple and stop purchasing Apple products.Remember that if you buy Apple products, as their bully terms, you give Apple right to make you suffer!Date of experience:July 16, 2022",4,Judy Zhou,1,New Zealand,2022-07-16 00:00:00.000000,last new pro old chose protect difficult notice black light call warranty diagnose technician diagnose technician screen open new small black faulty direct wrong faulty faulty drive several open faulty many good faulty faulty black terrible suffer,Negative
"Surprise surprise: Apple does not care about youI've been an Apple client for years, bought all sort of electronic devices and accessories. A little over a year ago I purchased a cover for the iPad with a rotating handle. The handle functions as a support for the iPad, allowing you to set it in different positions. A few weeks after the warranty expired, the handle broke apart. In a matter of days the plastic holder of the handle just gave up. I called customer service, I asked if it was defective or if they had other complaints about this product. I had to speak with 3 representatives, spent over 30 minutes on the phone (without counting the wait time), I was finally promised a reply within a few business days. A week later I haven't heard from them. I guess they don't really care about the one customer that has a problem with an item. I know there is nothing I can do, and I know I'll not stop buying from Apple because of this one item, but I'm still annoyed that the fact that I've been a good customer for years does not count at all.

I loved everything about my Apple device and have continually stuck with the Apple ecosystem.  That changed today because of the complete disregard for my time and effort by Apple support policies.

I had a 4:00 apt and showed up shortly after and waited for 30 mins. After another hour we got the same error instore and  the person at the Genius Bar told me that 4013 was a failure in the logic board.  This just kept going down hill because my Apple Care was 2 weeks out of date and the $450 would not be covered.  Apple you want my suggestion, don't waste almost 5 hours of your customer's time to tell the you can't do jack for them.

"iPhone 13 Pro Max simply amazing and great Apple services.I recently went in to the Regent Street store in London and despite it being quite busy was seen quite quickly. I bought the iPhone 13 pro max because I like to study and work on the go and also watch a lot of entertainment and read while travelling; but I don’t always like the faff of the larger screened iPads, as great as they are, I like to just pop my device in and out of my pocket as I need it. The pro max is almost like a little iPad, it’s got decent enough screen estate to do most work stuff and it’s great for watching movies or streaming your favourite series (the aspect ratio and proportions of the screen is much better than Samsung as there is better width, so better portrait immersion as well as in landscape, other phones like Samsung seem to favour a weird narrow style), and the sound quality from the speakers is wonderful IMO. The quality of engineering in this device is simply brilliant. The user experience is seamless and intuitive which is exactly what I like, all your services are integrated in the Apple ecosystem, but you can access other services if you want.It’s got the power, the versatility to be a lot of things and it feels very premium, even with the MagSafe case it looks and feels amazing.I don’t often get excited about using a device but it’s a genuine enjoyment to use the 13 pro max on a day to day basis.Great job Apple, keep up the good work!Date of experience:July 13, 2022",2,Will H,5,United Kingdom,2022-07-13 00:00:00.000000,great regent busy great like little decent screen great width seem weird narrow wonderful brilliant user intuitive excited use pro good,Positive

"My history with AppleAbout fifteen years ago I purchased an Iphone and a Ipod. They were fine but no better than cheaper alternatives and on one front a lot worse. The batteries in both died after very moderate usage. Nine years on I purchased an Ipad. Tried to log on to the Apple system but as I did not remember my password or old phone number it was impossible. I gave up after much frustration. I will say my Ipad is excellent more six years on the battery holds its charge for months. Recently I purchased two reconditioned ipods to listen to Audible books. Audible decided to close their Windows app that worked with the iPod. The replacement turns out to only work with the latest iPod. This was a fact I discovered after four hours of trying to sort out my password only to have to get a new account with a new email address. Then I had to fill in a lengthy form on the iPod's tiny screen and the keypad designed for the finger size of a three year old.Six months ago I considered an iPhone purchase but then remembered how difficult Apple make it to carry out the simplest process (eg. File transfer). Bought a top of the range Samsung instead.Date of experience:July 09, 2022",2,Richard Haylock,2,United Kingdom,2022-07-09 00:00:00.000000,fine moderate password old impossible much excellent audible audible close worked new new lengthy tiny difficult carry top,Positive

"Do not buy anything from the Apple…Do not buy anything from the Apple website. I bought an iPhone 13 pro max from their site and got batteries that weighed the same as my iPhone to make me think it was my iPhone. They are not even able to give an explanation but want me to justify myself. I sent them pictures of their package with the batteries and nothing happened. They don't want to open an investigation. It's crazy for a seller. What seller does this with impunity?  And you can't file a complaint against them from Europe if you look at the terms and conditions, the legal seat is only in the US.

"iPhone mini is the futureiPhoneI will write it in English in the hope someone in America will pickup this. I like the Apple iPhone after almost 12 years using Samsung phones, but I hate the growing big ones phones and specifically the new iPhone 14 release this year 2022 with no 14 mini only four terrible big sizes in 6,1 till 6.7 inches where there is no place in your pocket for the big sizes. What a terrible sizes. Not handy on holiday with your short on flip flops on walking around to show your big iPhone as an cool box in your back pocket and There you are walking with your big iPhone in your back pocket in your shorts where your iPhone sticks out so big. Apple is making a big mistake by stopping with small phones.  I'm an 53 year old male and I can work easily with small iPhones more easily with one hand than a full size phone cool-box in my ass. It looks terrible to see Stick out the half of your iPhone out of your short. I am using an phone case on my belt and looks more professional and secure, than to show an big size stupid 6.1 or 6.7 inch and wait that someone steel it out of your pocket. I hope that Apple will think account on a large group of people who choose for a smaller phone.  Bring the IPhone mini back to the iPhone 15. In 2023, And don’t make a mistake for making bigger unusual 6.1, 6.7 bigger and stupid bigger phones, before you know will Apple lost his costumers and will surf around for another small mini phone from an other brand, Thank you Apple!Date of experience:July 08, 2022",2,Mathieu,1,Netherlands,2022-07-08 00:00:00.000000,write big new terrible big till big terrible handy short big big big big small old male small full terrible stick short professional big stupid large make unusual stupid small,Negative
"Youtube how to fix your iphone before falling victim to apples scamRecently dropped my iphone and that caused the phone to get stuck in a boot loop where the apple logo would flash but the phone was not turned on. Right before the phone stopped working I got an error message that the face ID was no longer working. After doing some research myself I found out that if the face id camera gets water damaged it can cause a shortage to the logic board causing the phone not to turn on. I went an hour away to an apple store near me and I told them exactly what I stated above and his response was that they dont have any way to open it up and its most likely that the logic board is fried and the phone wont start up meanin that I would need to either spend 600 on a replacement or double that on a new phone. My main issue here was that I had not backed up my phone so there was important data on there that I needed and he told me my only other option would be to send it out to california and potentially be charged up to FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS to save my data... because the company is reputable lol. I made the right choice to take matters into my own hands and youtube how to remove the face id component. After weeks of waiting for the right tools to open the phone because they make it near impossible to do so for this exact reason, I come to find that I am correct, I unplug the face ID and my phone comes back to life. This company is pure evil and the definition of greed. Sadly so many people wont know or would be scared to try and figure it out on their own and they lose important data because of how greedy these people are.

"Worse Customer Service ever!Bought this I-12 direct from Apple primarily for my wife to use monitoring her glucose levels with the Abbott Labs developed Libre 2 system.  I already had an I-12 mini and we enabled the system to communicate any alarms to me, as my wife is almost deaf and often doesn't hear the high or low sugar level alarms.  Worked great for a couple months until Apple upgraded the iOS from 13 to 14.  This completely broke the communication between the phone and the sensors (NFC).  Apple was condescending and did not care about our problem.  They refused to help me go back to the 13 version until Abbott could research the problem.

"Operating system is goodOperating system is good. Password keeper is good. But if you like entering passwords all the ducking time you should definitely buy this crap. No sense storing your apple password to keeper. It will never auto fill it. Won’t even show the key when you have to use it. I have fingerprint set up. To purchase things from iTunes. I have to use fingerprint which should be enough. But I assume that apple doesn’t trust its own technology. Next it will ask for my apple password. Then once you chose something to purchase. It will ask for password again. Absolutely a waste of time. Why have a fingerprint scanner if apple doesn’t trust it. Garbage!!!!’ Extremely irritating.  Fingerprint, facial Id, voice recognition are ways to track you. Next they will add a blood tester to unlock your phone. They are already in bed with the government. No fingerprint on all new iPhones . The reason why.the authorities do not have to ask for your consent or get a warrant to unlock your phone. Fingerprint requires a warrant. Batteries are sealed in the phone so you can’t remove it. All for tracking purposes. Siri and google both recognize voices. They both are always running in the background. So when your friends are around it knows everyone around your devices thanks to all you idiot sheepeople. Freedoms are being taken away while you mentally challenged  are facebooking and twittering about dumbshit. We are not free if your government is tracking your every move like we are the enemies.

"Bad service for Butterfly Keyboard…Bad service for Butterfly Keyboard problemMy dad bought a new MacBook Pro 13"" in 2017 for 2000EUR in Belgium. It slowly began to show problems related to the butterfly keyboard problems. Apple started a Keyboard Service Program in 2019. Now some keys even don't work any longer. You have to push them very hard. My dad said that it always was more difficult to write long letters but thought it was his fault. Now that the problem got worse we went to an official apple service store, lab9. They referred to the service program and said it was a free repair. The laptop went in for diagnosis. After a few days he got a call from the store. The program is valid for 4 years after purchasing. Now he has to pay 700EUR.There is also a problem with the screen. It show vertical flikkering lines. Those lines are only visible on grey or light blue parts on the screen. For this problem he has to pay 800EUR. The repair costs are totally crazy.We called Apple Support. They said the program expired and they would not help us in any other way. Even after a call with a senior they refused to help.My dad paid a lot of money for a good quality product. He expected to do 6 or 8 years with his machine. Instead he got a faulty product that was never working good. The arrogance of Apple Support was shocking. We are deeply disappointed in the quality and service from Apple.The butterfly keyboard problem is a hidden default on the date of purchase. The new laptops have a better keyboard since 2019.

"Apple is a clinically insane companyApple, as a company, is irredeemably paranoid about security. It is their all consuming obsession and it is so bad it is preventing me from doing something as simple a changing my email address/Apple ID.In order to change my email address I was presented with two security questions I answered about fifteen years ago and although they were only answerable in one way, i.e., who was your best friend as a teenager and what was your first car; not things you are likely to forget, Apple told me I as wrong and prevented me from getting any further.The insanity enters at this point.In order to reset these security questions, they asked me to answer one of them again!! I still couldn't answer so that was that. Catch 22. Who in their right mind asks a question that has already been proven unanswerable in order to change that same question?? I spent two 45 minute phone calls with Apple support in order to try to get this problem solved. The support guy was very patient but he couldn't fix it and he wants to call me again next week to try once more. Neither he nor I are confident. The problem appears insurmountable which means that when my old email address is switched off, all the apps I bought with it will need to be downloaded or purchased again. The issue is that all the configurations, progress and additions made to these apps will be gone. It's fu***** madness! Every other account I have updated where this kind of issue arose was fixable because the company concerned sent an email with a link in it that I could use to reset the login/password/security question/whatever. Apple however are fanatical fundamentalists who consider that if you cannot answer a fifteen year old question then you are not who you say you are. End of story.

"I am more than fit to be tied with…I am more than fit to be tied with Apple in particular the online sales force who claim they know their computers.  Not so.  We have a small recording studio and have had Mac's for years.  Late last year, we had to replace an existing Mac so I ordered through the online store.  I was told over and over by the sales fellow at Apple that we would be able to upgrade the program once the MacPro was in our possession.  Computer came and then was told at my end that NO THE PROGRAM COULD NOT BE CHANGED.  So the computer has to be returned which put our studio in a very stressful position.  We held off and just two months ago put an order in for the Mac Pro Studio and was told by the incompetent on line sales staff that 64GB unified memory of the new computer would accommodate our plug-ins.  ONCE AGAIN NOT TRUE so now in order to have this Mac studio work we need to buy a satellite which is beyond costly and something are budget really cannot accommodate but WE HAVE NO CHOICE.  What the heck is wrong with Apple on line sales people.  They are cocky on the phone and they don't even know their product.  I am furious with Apple and frankly we have decided to go back to a PC when needed and I will never, ever buy another product from Apple and that includes the IPhone.

"Wouldnt fix phone in warranty and made me feel like a liar!Always had Apple products since the iphone 3GS so thats almost 15 years ago. phone, macbook and watch. Bought an iphone X new from the Apple store 2 years ago and a short time after having it, it developed a sensor issue and needed to go back in for a warranty fix. no issues, got the phone back without any problems and the issue was fixed. I have always used a protective bumper silicone case with all my phones and this one was no different. Anyway, still within the warranty period (just about), the phone developed another issue where it would randomly reboot. I reported this and as it was during covid, they said to post it off and sent the box etc out to do that. I posted the phone off and when they received it, they refused to fix it, citing the reason was that it had 'been opened before and therefore the warranty was void'. i responded and indicated it was them that carried out the previous warranty repair and could back this up with receipts etc but i also knew they would have their own records of this. Anyway, several back and forwards later and they said the screws on the bottom of the phone were marked and that their support staff would never have left them like that. i said the phone hadnt been anywhere else but that maybe the bumper case had caused some wear along the bottom. They said this was unlikely and basically called me a liar and said they werent fixing it as the warranty was void. I appealed the decision but they came back with the same conculsion. When i got the phone back, i sold it, the watch and the macbook and moved to Android. Havent looked back since other than writing this review.

"iPhone 13 Pro Max Clear Case with MagSafeVery flimsy and extremely disappointing for the cost as just under £50. I’ve had it a couple of weeks and used once outside and it already has a crack in it. I expected much more resiliency. I’ve had £5 cases that worked better. Replacement isn’t easy either.

The display stopped working and now they are not honoring the AppleCare warranty.  We took the MacBook to an Apple store and they advised the repairs are not covered.  Both Costco and Apple are pointing fingers and shifting blame to each other.  We also called Apple tech support and customer relations and they were completely inept.

"Worst Customer Service ExperienceI bought $1100 worth of product and while placing an order online, I was promised to get my product on June 1st 2022. I had not be notified by anyone until I see the tracking details on the evening of June 1st and it says shipping will be delayed. So, on June 2nd - I have contacted Apple customer service where I have requested for the ""Good Will Gesture"" due to inconvenience caused to me and ""Jeda"" was the representative. She has filed a ticket and I was told that someone will reach out to me via my phone number. I got a call from John in couple of hours and John who was saying himself as a Senior Manager was super rude/arrogant starting from the call. He was saying it is no one's fault when product is getting delayed. I am not understanding how can it be no one's fault and he used the word, Apple can't do anything in this matter and I have only one option to wait for my product for which I have spent $1100. When I asked him to transfer it to his supervisor, very rudely he said, it is not possible as he is not seeing any concerning issue here.I surely have to think twice while companies like Apple can operate like this.Date of experience:June 02, 2022",4,Tapshil Panwala,1,United States,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000000,worth good due call senior possible,Positive

"The Customer Service Department ON PHONE needs improvement but First Colony in Sugar Land Texas is AWESOME!The Customer Service Department is quite confusing.  I called and reported my watch was no longer working.  They spoke nice and told me they would send me a box to return the watch in for fixing.  I waited for 2 days and called back.  Next person explained the order was cancelled and they were not sure why.  I purchased the Apple Care Plan at the time of the purchase of the watch and phone.  It is worth it also and kept all receipts to verify my purchases.  This was quite frustrating.  However, after about 8 days, the customer service office told me to go to the nearest store to turn the watch in for repair.  It took about 8 days to get it back, because they had to examine the watch to see if it was something I did to the watch to keep it from working.  Well, the store in Sugar Land Texas, First Colony Mall was quite helpful and kind and courteous.

"software update deleted 2k picsSoftware update deleted 2 thousand photos. Apple support said only way to get them back was to restore from previous back up (2 weeks ago) They said I would lose all data and photos from that time but I would get my photos back. I’ve tried restoring photos exactly how they requested probably 15-20 times and never have been able to restore a single photo. I tried explaining this to them but was constantly getting interrupted by the Support Supervisor. Nice. She told me I should have just bought the extra icloud storage. Well great how does that help my situation now? Anyways I did the restoration and lost all my data which I’m very frustrated about and sure enough NOT A SINGLE PHOTO WAS RESTORED. So according to apple it’s on me because I didn’t buy their extra icloud storage even though a SOFTWARE UPDATE deleted TWO THOUSAND random photos off my phone from the past year/two years. Absolutely horrible customer service/support (3 other advisors just stopped chatting with me after saying “i’ll look into that just give me a moment” so I was on apple support/ talking to the supervisor for 4 1/2 hours. Yes, I am frustrated at the fact my photos were deleted. I am even more frustrated with how I was being treated. Every other sentence was being interrupted by the supervisor while I was trying to explain my issue. Ultimately she said “you’re just going to have to take one loss or the other” Why? Because apple decided to do an automatic update while I was asleep and I “should have backed it up before updating it” like I knew it was going to update and should have expected apple to just go through and delete tons of photos.On another note, their products are trash I got the iphone 12 new and within 2 months it was running slowly and glitching out but “they couldn’t see a problem with it” so warranty didn’t cover it. Also, my battery within those few months had gone to complete dog sh!t and of course warranty wouldn’t cover it. Why did I even pay for the two year warranty if they’re not gonna fix it?? And it’s been extra slow since the iphone 13 came out of course. Also got a brand new series 6 watch which the screen was having major issues. Like it would just black out for hours at a time but since apple techs couldn’t replicate it they wouldn’t fix it. Honestly apple is a complete scam in every way and although, I’ve said I was never going to get an android, they give you so much more in a product in quality, performance, and overall software bs especially for cheaper in some cases.

"Poor APPLE servicePoor…. I think Apple as a business is becoming like tesco. We pay top dollar premium price for apple products and expect premium service.Poor customer service. This is my second interaction with apple store in the last few months because of issues with BEATS products.First time, BEATS studio headphones broke at the ear piece. It was a manufacturing defect in warranty period. I sent the phones back to the repair place and they duly sent back refurbished headphones back. One, i have an issue with refurbished product replacement in warranty period. Not expected from a premium company like apple. Not only that …. Instead of the special edition specially chosen colour, I got black headphones. Not even like for like. Customers pay the very high price and choose specisl colours for a reason. When there is a manufacturing defect on your part, you give extra care to the customer. Not use some small print to treat them poorly and without any consideration.This time again, there is a manufacturing defect with the BEATS buds bought three months ago. Instead of replacing them in the store, they have to be sent to the repair shop. It will take 4 weeks apparently.

"Applecare theft/lossI know there seems to be a general consensus of negative reviews on here about Apple but I wanted to come on here and commend their applecare/customer service based on my recent experience. After getting my month old new Iphone 11 pickpocketed at a market in London, I submitted a claim with applecare theft and loss. I had only a month before had my previous (very old and smashed) Iphone stolen from me, which was not insured with applecare. This prompted me to take the precaution to purchase the theft and loss package when I bought my Iphone 11. The applecare claim process was very quick and straightforward via an online form format. Once I submitted the claim online, I called customer services to ensure I'd done everything right and that it had been submitted properly. They were extremely helpful and I received my new phone two days later. I would definitely recommend investing in the Applecare Theft/loss package especially if you live anywhere in or like London.

They have now changed the way the cord plugs into the adapter and instead of a usb, it is now a c type end that you plug into the adapter. So you have NO CHOICE but to have to go BUY an adapter after ALREADY paying THOUSANDS on phones. And their excuse for it is “part of their global mission to stop carbon emissions”.

"30 year journey loaded with Apple goodnessAbout 12 years ago, I started using Apple phones with the 3gs iPhone. I buy a new iPhone almost every year, but each phone provides 3-4 years of service as my wife and children use 'hand me downs' when I change.  Yes, an annual iPhone shuffle! :)During these 12 years, I've used over ten different iPhones, and NOT ONE has presented a problem that Apple didn't promptly resolve.  Most never had any issue.  I've sometimes wondered if the extended warranty has been necessary, but I think it is worthwhile for the duration we use them!I've also purchased an iMac, Macbook Pro, AirPods, iPad, AirPod Pro, and other devices.  It hasn't been all smooth sailing across all these devices, but on the rare occasion I've faced issues, Apple has always taken pride in resolving them to my satisfaction. I'm pragmatic and believe problems and electronics are inevitable.  What matters to me is the frequency and how they resolve issues when they do arise.  In that regard, Apple set the standard for consumer electronics. I recently had an event where I inquired about an out-of-warranty device issue. Apple support engaged me comprehensively and ultimately replaced the item FOC (Free Of Charge) as it ""Didn't meet their standards"".  I went to their service centre expecting to spend and came away with a free replacement.  That only comes from an organisation that will stand by its products.I started as an Apple II computer user in the late '80s and, after a lengthy break, joined their Mac world in 2012.  Since then, I've enjoyed the Apple echo system, which prioritises my needs and privacy.  I consider alternatives occasionally, but I currently see no serious contender.  Ease of use, reliability, longevity and delivering a complete package is all part of the reasoning behind my conclusion.If you consider Apple's pricing versus what they deliver holistically, I believe they are not the most costly.  It can be hard to differentiate purchase price from cost over a device's life, but you will not be disappointed when you can take that step!Date of experience:April 30, 2022",7,Adrian Ruzsicska,5,Singapore,2022-04-30 00:00:00.000000,new annual different warranty necessary pro rare pride pragmatic inevitable standard ultimately free free lengthy privacy serious complete costly hard differentiate take,Negative

"100% UNsatisfiedI ordered a very expensive new MacBook Pro, back on 4th March. The delivery timetable was clear on the Apple Store site -- I would have to wait longer because I was ordering the computer with the larger screen. Apart from choosing the model w/a 16"" screen, everything else about my order was standard.Nevertheless, Apple has apparently chosen not to stock these machines in its stores -- instead, the company with a larger market capitalisation than ANY OTHER COMPANY ON THE PLANET has opted for the 'just-in-time' supply chain strategy favoured by most other large multinationals.That's all fine, so long as customer needs and expectations are managed proactively by Apple.But here, they have failed completely -- I was told at the time I placed my order that I should expect to wait roughly 8 weeks for delivery. This was irritating and put pressure on me to keep my ailing, 7-year-old MacBook Pro operational, but I was informed of the timetable for delivery BEFORE I placed my order, so at least I could make an informed decision.Now, however, Apple is apparently having supply chain problems.Two weeks ago, they confirmed I could expect delivery this week (w/c 25th April); today, I received an update announcing the new deliery window is now between 14-27th JUNE).The unfortunate customer service reps I spoke with after receiving this unwelcome news had nothing useful to tell me, other than the usual scripted acknowledgements of my frustration and apologies for inconvenience.Sorry, Apple -- THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.Perhaps consider dedicating a tiny fraction of your insane market cap to establishing a more diversified supply chain, given there's no end in sight to the factors we can all presume will continue to disrupt manufacturing for the foreseeable future.I look forward to the day when another disruptor comes along and finally deposes Apple as the only useful non-Windows/Android option.Date of experience:April 25, 2022",1,DD1970,1,United Kingdom,2022-04-25 00:00:00.000000,expensive new timetable clear large pro operational timetable informed update new unfortunate unwelcome useful usual good tiny foreseeable useful,Negative

"I traded in a laptop with Apple to…I traded in a laptop with Apple to purchase a new iPad. After chatting with another sales rep later, however, we discovered it would make more sense to stick with just an upgrade MacBook Pro. So I returned the iPad and went to order the MacBook instead. But! Even though the original trade in was done with a “procurement card” suddenly this time it couldn’t be done.I’ve spent days trying to get some kind of resolution out of Apple, but they just keep telling me they’ll elevate the situation to someone else and to wait a few more business days for someone else to review the situation. Now I’m stuck with over $700 on a gift card I never asked for that was never part of the original trade in that I can’t use for the one thing I traded in my laptop for. I have no computer, no way forward, and they’ve taken to ignoring most of my requests for assistance or updates, now.

Less than a week before the promised delivery date my order was magically cancelled. My bank received no attempt for a payment to be made. Apple customer service offered no information or compensation. Their only solution is make another order and wait for it to arrive and hope it’s not cancelled again. I estimate this shortcoming on apple’s behalf will cost me a minimum of $1250 and they really don’t seem to care that much.All my financial disparities aside, in terms of customer service they should have contacted me before cancelling.

"App Store: Anti-Competitive Practices, Review Inconsistencies, Selective BiasesSince April 1, 2022, what was supposed to be a simple bug fix update has turned into a nightmare. The App Review Team and App Review Board have been consistently rejecting my app, the reason being:""Guideline 4.3 - Design We continue to find that your app provides the same feature set as other apps submitted to the App Store; it simply varies in content or language, which is considered a form of spam.""This is 100% false because my app has unique features not found on other apps on the App Store. My app does comply with the App Store Review Guidelines because it offers unique, high quality features not found on other apps.Based on their definition of 4.3.0, their claim of my app violating 4.3.0 is false and not valid.The strange part is that the supposedly similar apps don't offer the features that my app offers, yet those apps are able to get their app submissions approved (April 2022).I should also mention that those apps were published after mine. I have already notified them about this. I have provided screenshots, video demos, source code, spoken to the App Review team and the App Review Board, filed numerous appeals and they are still rejecting the app because of 4.3.0.They appear to be ignoring the information I've been providing and are responding to me with generic responses.At this time, as I have exhausted all options, I've filed a complaint with the BBB and have consulted a lawyer to look at this case. Based on our initial investigation, it is evident that there is anti-competitive practices, selective bias, and unfair treatment going on in the App Store.

"I will NEVER again buy Apple, worst customer experience for every productThroughout my life, I’ve owned at least 10 apple products - and had only terrible customer service experiences with Apple each time. One time, they told me that my Macbook had water damage so they could not retrieve my data for me since it was “all rusted”. This was BS because my friend was able to recover everything for me weeks later. I’ve had other poor customer service experiences with them, but let’s talk about the one from today.Apple had a recall / product defect with their Macbook pro where the keyboard double types letters. I was not even notified about this that I know of, and if I was there was definitely no ‘deadline’ mentioned. I only found out through my friend.In the past year, I visited apple store multiple times to get this addressed, making appointments. Once, I even started a conversation online and she helped me make the Genius Bar appointment. Each time, the Genius Bar was delayed to the point that I waited 30+ minutes at the Genius bar and then had to go home or back to work. None of these visits were logged by Apple. Maybe because I never got to talk to a “genius” since they were all busy.Today, I went to the Apple store, finally made it to the Genius specialist, and they said they can’t fix my keyboard because the 4 year warranty passed 2 months ago. They saw no logs of me coming to the apple store to fix this, and said I have to contact support over the phone since they “don’t have the power to make an exception”. Phone specialist says they have to back up the store specialists, and that they have no record of me trying to fix this before Feb 25. Phone specialist also said the in store specialist DO have the power to make exceptions, and that the log shows “exception denied”. So they managed to log this, but not the numerous times I talked to Apple? And they lied about not “having the authority to make this decision” lol.Are you kidding me? Because of your incompetent product and incompetent service and incompetent logging system, I’m stuck with your defective Macbook with a keyboard that can’t do its job. I swear I will never purchase another Apple product again, this is the absolute last straw.For your information, I have an iPad, an Apple Watch, apple pen, Macbook Pro, iPhone - and I’ve had other iPads, iPhones, Macbooks in the past.

"Apple is HORRID - DONT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCEApple is, by far, the WORST company I've ever dealt with.I bought an Ipad to try it out. It's so irritating because it's constantly telling me to buy icloud space because I'm out (without ever actually using it mind you).Next, I go to let my wife use it. But I can't turn off the fingerprint lock garbage. I try adding her as a family member sharing. It makes her go get an apple id using a credit card and everything just to not let her join because the process is so convoluted that it literally brakes. It sends her an email invite that can only be opened on an apple device, and ONLY using their proprietary email app. Then, it pops up and asks to click on the invitation - but there aren't any. So we both just wasted 30 minutes, my wife had to get an apple id and jump through all these hoops just to not have their stupid family sharing garbage work. Why lock a device I purchased. It is MY PROPERTY after I buy it. Apple acts like their tech is their property after they sell it to you at over inflated prices.So, I get on the line with support. And they cut the call then ask me to fill out a survey about whether I'll recommend them or not.

"Absolute Disgrace...My late father,who passed away suddenly left 3 iPhones (two old, one new), without any passcodes or passwrds (only his apple ID). Contacted Apple Support and was told to send through a copy of his Death certificate and proof of Executor/Will, which I did. Was told to cancel his account so that it would release phones for future use, which I did. Finally, got round to resetting them back to factory settings, to find that the phones were still registered to his name? Rang Apple Support again to be told that they needed more information of where the phones were purchased before they could release/unlock the phones from his account (that they said they were going to cancel after the 30 day notice period to my Dad's registered email account after their suggestion to close it). Couldn't exactly ask my Dad now and no receipts found... So basically, despite a death certificate, copy of his will, his apple email and proof who I was, three iPhones can't be recycled now. Well done Apple, so much for recycling/saving the planet and spending hours on the phone with you during a very upsetting time.

Avrò contattato il supporto specialistico per più di 10 volte per risolvere il problema ma senza alcun successo, devono fare le loro verifiche.

I contact the specialist support again and in the morning of 03/25 I send the package back to apple support. It arrives at apple this morning and after a couple of hours that the technicians were inspecting my macbook I see an email arriving in which I am blamed for accidental damage on the keyboard (I did not use the macbook pro when it returned from the first assistance). Obviously before sending the package I always take demonstration photos to certify the integrity of the product and, to date, nobody wants to see my photos. I will have contacted the specialist support more than 10 times to solve the problem but to no avail, they have to do their own checks.

"Apple re-introduce 50's housewife style mores; wait at home all day on us little woman....Oh yes you will.Would give minus 10 if there was the option.Spent 1K on an order of 2 items; they split up the order without advance notification, so you are chained to an at-home delivery AND a car trip to the store. They don't allow you to combine the two in one delivery. Of course not.They are expedite and super efficient at removing the cash from your account; then the agony begins.Tranche of bonkers nonsensical emails that contain gobbledygook force you to spend time noone has on procuring contact via live chat/calls. (eg of an email - subject header implies the email is re the ipad air delivery, yet content is a load of ill spaced out, oddly random text that seems to be about the other part of the order) - and it looks like a 3 year old has gotten onto mum's computer and pressed send after jiggling around with the content, five times. Randomly plonking bits of text here and there. No joining up and no salient relevance to the order details you're seeking. Desperately seeking by now as it's day 3 after order placement and still no clue as to when and WHAT TIME the order is arriving at the home address.Hour of life spent on live chat nets varying reports re delivery details (which are missing  even up to and including the day before the delivery) - and still no clue as to the time.One girl on live chat (16.3.22- circa 6pm) suggests  - why of course I can pick one of the hourly time slots when they land in advance of the day of delivery - yet when STILL nothing has landed the day before (today) - I force myself to call in to speak to a human and find out what on earth is going on with the chaos, mess and totally at expense of the customer's sanity. Not to mention working hours drained away....The next call nets the total opposite - yes, wait for it - the brand Apple sees fit to re introduce 50's style housewife expectations; you WILL SIT INDOORS ALL DAY, MRS, WAITING FOR ME.Apparently it's me asking a bit much - not to have to give up 8am - 8pm on a work day - because...this...is....Apple....this is how we roll. You wait on us beatch.I'm supposed to feel better about giving up 12 hours waiting on these amoral greedsters - because  - wait for it - they will tell me the hour they will deliver in. ON THE DAY! MORNING OF! Ok bye bye any plans any meetings anything at all for the whole day from 8-8pm as I won't know until tomorrow morning when the delivery will come. Yay. 2022. Hello.When even arcane old school risible brands like British Gas having to step into modern day living - and not demand customers sit in all day waiting on their arrival - this blows Apple off the stratosphere of oxymoronic; a so called TECH company - branding itself as er progressive and forward thinking - now expects us to sit in all day - waiting on them....Yikes. Reality check so big needed that it doesn't exist.Couldn't make it up.Apple - a brand that sunk the amoral abyss of capitalism gone so horribly wrong - even lower.They don't care you've spent your time, your money, your sanity, your everything on days trying to work out what on god's earth is going on with their chaotic and ridiculous delivery system (they don't have one; they are so tight they allocate the courier company the night before - they are clearly waiting on the cheapest deals on delivery) - they really couldn't give a damn about the consumer. And their blatant hubris and ****-off attitude shows they're actually quite proud of their lack of any self awareness whatsoever.A so called senior complaints manager actually suggested there was something amiss with my attitude - to raise the subject of 50's style housewife ambitions from Apple's desire for money money money - it's cheaper for them that way of course....But she wants to tell me off for telling the truth; not a comfortable concept - the truth - for Apple. They like to talk down and boy do they go far with that premise that you're the dumbo and tell you off they will, talking over you and threatening to end calls - over - the truth.Have the customer held to ransom while they spend less on efficient and commensurate delivery. She also suggested that the customers' purchasing didn't pay for either staff  nor for Apple's existence.... :) No, sure, the fairy rainbow unicorns pay salaries. The fairy rainbow unicorns are - however - certainly in charge of deliveries - if you chase them for hours, over days.....Hubris beyond belief; of course you're expected to take a day off work, of course you're expected to wait ON US - we are the MIGHTY APPLE. Sit down and shut up little woman - was my lot. By a woman. #shameThey employ a company just to deal with complaints. Not entirely convinced it's the right one.

"APPLE, APPLE SYTEMS  AND APPLECARE.Apple have some of the greatest products out there.... and some of the worst systems. The review should (and would) be FIVE STAR, if it wasn't for some of Apple's apparent intransigence.Feedback below given to Apple on a recent interaction.The advisor Kevin was great, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The system somewhat less so.Firstly, the automated system is not fit for purpose in any way shape or form! Considering where we are present day, with voice recognition, your automated system seems rooted somewhere in the late 1980s! It never has any idea what is being requested, which always results in me (and probably many others) just shouting obscenities at it! And then normally ending up at the wrong department, therefore wasting an advisor's time and further frustrating valued customers!Secondly, and even more importantly, I have all my music (a lifetime's music) purchased legitimately, so therefore mine, to do whatever I wish, within the realms of the law, that is now stuck on my iPhone and cannot be transferred back to my very expensive, new, top of the range custom order iMac!!! This is due to my old iMac, just stopping working! There needs to be an easy way to recover data from a malfunctioning Mac and more importantly, Apple need to make available the sort of 3rd party programmes that there are out there, for eventualities such as this! Please listen to your customers! We are personally, Apple aficionados, we have EVERY Apple product there is! We intend to stay Apple customers for ever, but that doesn't mean that we will. How can Apple leave some of their best customers (ie best advertising stream) feeling frustrated and angry? Come on Apple, must do better for the customers that you already have, and then, spend the astronomical budgets attracting others. Word of mouth and customer satisfaction is KING!

"Apple has the worst customer service -5 is my reviewIf I could only give apple customer service a negative -1. I could give them negative one. I just experienced the worst shopping experience I've ever had in my life. After my phone got lost in transit apple couldn't let me go to the store and just pick up the phone from the store because it was an online order. After calling back and forth between ups and Apple for 3 days. Someone finally told me that my phone had got lost in transit.. they sent me a new phone, after 6 days. As soon as I receive the phone I noticed that the phone was too small for me so I called them and ask them if I can go in the store and exchange for a different phone. Of which at the time they told me that they couldn't do it. that the only thing they could do is send me a refund. What the representative didn't mention is that I had to wait until after apple received the phone for them to be issue a refund. When the representative sent me the shipping label after reading the shipping label it stated three steps for me to get my refund.1 print the label, 2 take the phone to the UPS, once we receive the phone we will refund you. So in the end I ended up having to drive in traffic for 45 minutes to Apple store just so that I can return the package. After paying $860 for a phone they wanted me to just go ahead and purchase a new phone and wait for the money to come back to me. Some of us just don't have $800 just sitting around. Apple really needs to train their customer service Representatives. So now I have to wait for 5 days  until I get my refund to get a new phone. I have been without a phone for almost 8 days now I have to wait another 5 days. Terrible customer service.

"Apple just told me to live without a phone for 2-3 daysApple just managed to deliver the most horrible, non-customer-centric, and ultimately heartless customer service that I've ever received in my entire life. I'm a very calm person and this is the first time I've ever complained about any service ever ever 🙁. I'm writing this for potential new or current Apple customers to shed light on how Apple treats their customers in after-sales, I just feel like it's just the right thing to do.The story: I went to the official Apple store in Berlin to get a screen crack on my #iPhone (I assume the most common issue) repaired. After talking to someone for 15 minutes they kept my phone and told me to come back in 1h and pay the 29€ since I have Apple Care+ for that phone. When I came back, they tell me they discovered some unexpected water damage in the phone (which I assume could have come from showing the QR-code for the Genius bar appointment outside - it was raining and I had a cracked screen after all..).The problem: After the ""repair"" half of the screen of the before-perfectly-working phone now doesn't work anymore, which makes the phone practically unusable. They say I need to replace the complete phone for 99€, which I find disappointing, but am willing to do. However they don't actually have a phone in the store and I should come back in 2-3 days to get and pay for my replacement.So effectively they're telling me: Sorry, but please get lost with a phone that we completely broke and live without a phone for 2-3 days. Obviously this is a problem / impossible in today's world for both work and personal life!So I ask for a replacement phone for the 2-3 days: Nope.I ask whether the other Apple Store in the city (far away) could help me: They cannot say and won't even tell me whether they have a phone in store, but expect me to just go and hope. They refuse to call and ask them, because it's not the policy.I ask to speak to the store manager: They send someone who tries to pretend to be the store manager, who tells me to just accept it.I ask for the real store manager: A women called Ulrike (she refuses to tell me her last name) comes and claims to be the real store manager. I explain the situation and she just says there is nothing she can do (including not connected me with someone higher up, who could solve the problem).At this point I'm actually just very confused and sad. I cannot believe that this is the way Apple treats a customer that has spent €10k+ on Apple products privately during his life, not even counting using and evangelising their products at work. I actually love Apple products from both a design and product perspective and I also work in tech so I know, or at least hope, that HQ Apple would hate to see their customers be treated this way.I'm honestly just so confused, sad, and disappointed. I still cannot believe what just happened, I'm an business owner myself and I (and I hope every other business owner) would never-ever-ever treat customers this way. The most ironic part: I'm writing this from my (Apple!) MacBook Pro, since my phone doesn't work...Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading. Hope this helps potential future Apple customers know where they stand when they have a problem that doesn't fall into the Apple standard processes.

"So disappointed to write this reviewSo disappointed to write this review. I have always used Apple products and am (was?) a huge fan. However, I bought Airpod Pros, and these are by far the worst Apple product I have ever used. I took them back to the shop now 4 times, and spent hours on the phone with their tech support. They replaced first one airpod, the the second, then the case, then did firmware updates and still they drop calls, switch between devices when not meant to, and Apple does nothing to truly fix the problem.  I bought the AirPods at an airport shop after my original AirPods stopped holding a charge (they were old, and no complaints, those had worked well for several years). Apple uses this excuse to not stand 100% behind their product. Very poor. When Apple does this, they lose the reason people are willing to pay a premium. And I highly recommend not wasting you money and time on Airpod Pros.Date of experience:February 14, 2022",2,Steven Gray,1,United Kingdom,2022-02-14 00:00:00.000000,disappointed write huge worst shop second fix original old several poor lose willing,Negative
"Wonderful Customer Service from AppleI cannot express my thanks sufficiently for the excellent customer service, help and advice I received from Justin at Apple during my lengthy telephone conversation this afternoon (between the UK and the USA).   Justin was extremely patient and took great pains to ensure that my queries had been answered, going beyond the call of duty to give me advice as to where I could purchase a new battery in UK for my Apple Iphone.  He carried out a diagnostics test which clarified why my iPhone was not working properly and gave me suggestions and his considered opinion as to what my best course of action should be.  As I am 75-year old pensioner and not very technically-savvy, his guidance was invaluable and he assured me throughout our conversation that he was only doing his job in taking the time and making the effort to solve my problem.  An added bonus was the fact that this lengthy telephone call was free of charge to me.   I have never telephoned Apple before but will not hesitate to do so again, if necessary, since I have had such a good experience of its customer care.Date of experience:February 13, 2022",1,Marianne,5,United Kingdom,2022-02-13 00:00:00.000000,wonderful express excellent lengthy patient great call give new old invaluable lengthy free necessary good,Positive

It's now a week since I ordered my Macbook and I don't know when — or even IF — I will get my money back. The only possible explanation is that I the consumer am under suspicion!

"Apple is dead, they just haven't figured it out yetI was an Apple user from 2013 to 2020.Although their products were significantly more expensive than other brands, I kept buying iPhone after iPhone and iPad after iPad, plus iWatch and other accessories... Until last year when I got disgusted by their greed.My last iPad Pro just stopped working after 2 years and 1 month. People were telling me before that they sell products with just the right amount of defects or low-quality parts so they stop working 3 years after they are been bought, but this time this expensive piece of garbage didn't even reach 2 years and a half. Before it shut down forever, it would discharge in about 40 minutes of usage, which completely defeats the purpose of having a mobile device. I had to walk around the office with a changer and prey I found an outlet that's not taken by other Apple users. Same with my last iPhone.What is the purpose of having a mobile phone if it won't last you at least while you are at the office???In 2020 I decided that I am not going to give them another chance of ripping me off and I bought a Samsung tablet and phone. I can finally use my mobile devices away from the outlet.I wonder when people are going to figure out that this company is dead. It makes me think of the frog example. You put a frog in a pot filled with boiling water, it's going to jump out immediately, but if you put the frog in cold water and you start to heat it up progressively, it would die there boiling.

"Won't get fooled again !!Won't get fooled again !!The following is my reply to Apple after they asked for 'feedback' following my recent visit to one of their 'genius' bars.I am an ex Apple engineer and I will not waste money on another one of their cynical 'nerd traps'Take my advice there are better , cheaper alternativesto paying double for faulty goods and being slapped in the face if you complain.This is my feedback:-------------------------------------------------------------After being told I would have to pay something like £10 for a magsafe charger replacement . by one of Jack's colleagues. (One of 4 magsafes I have that were constructed with sub standard cable which has frayed and constitutes a shock hazard)I was then told by XXXX that it would cost £56 to replace the faulty product that Apple sold to me in the first place. I was astounded that a 'replacement' was almost the price of buying a new one.I was an Apple hardware engineer in my past and have owned a new mac desktop or laptop or phone every couple of years since my first SE30 and 3GS phone.I am now changing all of my gear to Android and Linux products because frankly Apple products are overpriced and in my time as a user I have watched (with horror) the way the company has become arrogant and dismissive of it's loyal customers.Other products are available and I will urge anyone in the future to not even consider an Apple item because they are bad value for money and the attitude to customers with problems absolutely stinks.(Before Apple gets on it's high horse about this only being my 'opinion' I would like to remind them that I used to organise spares and replacements in the 90s)-I never signed a non disclosure agreement about their practices so if anyone wants to ask me how cynical their operation is ,- get in touch!Lets get this in perspective, at one point a few years ago I had 2 dead Macbook Pro13""s with faulty graphics that Apple refused to acknowledge as a problem. I also had 2 Ipads that had shut down. Another problem Apple would not acknowledge.Nearly £4000 of equipment that died within 2 years of purchase!The solution apparently was to buy a large amount of Applecare to protect me against the faulty products Apple had sold me.I would respect you more if you supplied a roll of insulating tape with your products as most of your loyal customers have to buy their own.PMDate of experience:February 03, 2022",1,P M,1,United Kingdom,2022-02-03 00:00:00.000000,recent cynical double faulty first new new first android arrogant dismissive available future bad high non ask cynical touch perspective dead large loyal,Positive

"Apple is unethical and takes your money…Apple is unethical and takes your money without your permission. I have been charged for Apple TV since July of 2021 without my knowledge. I spoke with a senior advisor that stated to me that she can only do 60 days and theirs nothing else and no one else that I can speak with over her nor they can tell the usage. I call BS‼️ How is that possible. You’re definitely not the highest on command and you all make the damn devices and app how you can’t tell whether it’s been used or not and how are you the only person I can speak with like they don’t have a boss to report to. So now apple just take peoples money and can care less. The ONLY away I knew that this was happening is because I purchased an app today that doesn’t work and requested a refund. Instead of them doing it they provides a link to go and request a refund myself and low and behold there was the Apple TV charge. The online rep stated that a senior advisor would have to credit the charges since there was a lot only to find out they only give the same damn two months of credit. I spend too much damn money with this company to be treated as such. I want someone hire up to look into this matter, do your due diligence, and see that you all charged me for something that I never used or signed up for.

The person I talked to told me that he was not the one manufacturing the device, forgetting that he was representing Apple at that time.To cut it short, if you buy Apple devices, don't assume that they would have protection against water.

"Hi I’d just like to voice my…Hi I’d just like to voice my dissatisfaction with a recent store visit . Two weeks ago I visited the Apple Store in Booragoon Perth to have my screen fixed. The screen was fixed in about an hour and the phone was ready at the promised time. I bought and installed a screen protector but then after I got home, realised that I could no longer hear callers unless they were on speaker. So back to the store to have this issue checked After a diagnostic was performed, a faulty speaker was identified and a new screen booked in, same deal as last time, and a new screen protector was going to be added at no cost to me. When I went back to the store at the promised time to collect the phone, it wasn’t ready and I was directed to a table to wait. This table had no chairs and I waited 30 mins, then found someone to chase up my phone and the phone arrived, all fine and the speaker issue fixed but no screen protector, so this was then done. At all times the Apple team were lovely. BUT at no point did anyone applogise for the inconvenience to me of having to take time out of my day and drive an hour back to the store, nor did they apologise for having me wait 30 mins past my promised pick up time nor did they apologise for not having the screen protector done as promised. I’m a long time Apple lover, with 20 Apple products at my business but I just felt that an apology or a glass of water while waiting or a regular check in while I was waiting would have gone a long way.

"Apple is the biggest thief in the technology sector with their loopholes. BE AWARE!!!My review may sound very frustrating and that is because Apple has designed obvious loopholes in their system to steal from their customers. Here goes my story with them. I financed an Apple 13 pro and I got Apple Care+ with Theft and Loss which should cover your phone if it is lost. While traveling we were put to sleep and robbed at our Airbnb and our phones were stolen. When I tried to log in to my account, my phone was put into something that Apple calls ""Recovery Mode"" and they cut my access from my account for 18 days because people who stole it, tried to get into the phone and for security reasons, Apple put my account on such a long non-sense hold. After the 18 days was over, I logged into my account and my device was not showing under my account. Of course the thieves were not sitting around for me to log in and find their location. They either jalbroke my phone, or they took it into pieces and used the hardware.Here is Apple's loophole. In order to file a lost phone claim, I have to log into my account and put the phone in ""Lost Mode"" but this is not an option because for no reason my phone had disappeared and does not show on my account. How is that under my control? They are saying that I might have turn the ""Find My Phone"" option off which I never did. The funny fact is that when you turn that off, Apple sends you an email that the option was turned off. I never received that email and Apple knows that because they keep the record of everything in their system. In the end, Apple is telling me to go F*** myself because of their loophole I cant file a claim and the $1200 phone is gone. What is the point of getting insurance? I am switching from Apple after more than 10 years because their customer service and their ethics of business are disgusting. Apple gave 18 days to the thieves to do whatever they want so I have to go back and buy another phone from them. So unfair, so wrong. The fact is that I have insurance and my phone is stolen from me and the insurance has to cover it. Now the way to file is defined by Apple in a way for them to benefit from this. My case simply has to be filed manually because it is an error on Apple's system for not showing my device.Date of experience:January 15, 2022",60,kouroush mousavi,1,United States,2022-01-15 00:00:00.000000,aware obvious pro sleep log tried long log loophole funny loophole wrong,Negative

"Rapacious, greedy, profiteeringI bought a new iPhone online and at great expense. Apple said they would offer me a trade-in of £75 for my old iPhone. I said it was not in optimal condition and answered their questions about the condition of the phone accurately from the questions they ask. When I sent the phone back, they offered me £0.00 saying the camera screen was cracked. The questionnaire has limited number of questions and I was unable to indicate the camera screen was cracked which I wanted to do. Considering what they charge for a new phone, and it is not cheap, and how they lead you into believing there is a trade in available to lure the customer in to make a purchase. It’s wrong, its deceitful and its misleading. Apple as a brand is nothing more than a monument of greed. A nasty, self-centred and rapacious company that puts profit before anything else especially the customer or the environment. This phone will end up in landfill now as I am not giving to Apple for free. Well Apple, you may have sold one more phone but you have also now lost a customer for life. That is my last Apple product ever. I will tell everyone I meet of this story and put others off from buying your products. However ever small an impact that may amount to. It still makes a difference and you know that to be true as any good business model needs positive feedback. If every Apple customer stood up and demanded fairness, Apple would collapse.

Instead they want us to send it in for repair and go through the whole process for a minimum of 3-5 business days. I'm left to wait to use a product purchased at full price.

"Unrecoverable account???Now the lady was very cheery, so that was nice, however the reason for my call was that I wanted to get back into my apple ID to share my husbands cloud storage. I had successfully changed my password using my email, but the next step was some security questions that I do not remember filling in, however I do know the city where my parents met and my favourite car so I answer there and... No... OK so I try a different city since my mum and dad were from different towns even though I am positive that the first was correct, and No... So I go through the help menu, and several times I go through a loop of 'we don't have sufficient information to change your questions' so I google a help number and get through pretty quickly, all great! Nice lady speaks to me, I explain the issue, and here's the thing - if I can't log in, neither can they, therefore goodbye apple account on that email! Wait, really?? What so as an apple ID its now unrecoverable? Forever? My primary email? YES! Gone goodbye never to be seen again you will have to create a new account but NOT in that email as it is forever lost... Is this rational? Like I can log in as far as with my password via my email but I cannot reset security questions forever??? Wow apple have you got a lot to learn from Gmail.

"The Apple Card Doesn't Work At Apple StoreI purchased Airpods Pro using an Apple Card, via the Apple Store. On 4 occasions, I received confirmation of the order, and saw the delivery day/time. On all 4 occasions, Apple cancelled the order, without notifying me. I had no less than 6 calls with Apple support. Finally, a sales rep put the order through for me, using the same Apple Card. We'll see if the product arrives, or if Apple cancels it again. The problem is not with the Apple Card bank, according the Apple Card support desk at Goldman Sachs. None of the support people I spoke with had any idea why this was happening. My conclusion is that the Apple Store doesn't work with Apple Card, which is bizarre, although my card has been working everywhere else.

"Got ripped offMy sister bought 2 $50 itunes online gift cards for her brothers. When she completed the purchase it gave her a confirmation number and the emails were sent to her brothers. The money was taken from my sister's account for the cards. Here when Apple sent the gift cards they forgot to add the money on. When her brothers went to redeem their gift cards apple told them there wasnt any funds on the gift cards. When my sister talked to Apple support they told her that she is out $100 and that her brothers have to be entering the numbers wrong and that they couldn't find the order or confirmation number in their system and they will not issue her a refund nor would they add the due funds to the cards. Better yet apple no longer allows reviews on their site. Apple told my sister to either repurchase the gift cards or tell her brothers to enter the numbers correctly. How much more rude can they get.

"Worst customer service EVER!!Wouldn’t give Apple customer service any star but I have to in oder to leave a review. Apple customer service are awful and disrespectful af. They don’t tell you that they are switching over the call while you are speaking with them and you get cut off abruptly or transfer to another department without notice.I had purchased a Apple product and spoke had taken the money out of my account, I went there and waiting fir the product because I had a time slot ( why give time slots when they work on their own time or in that bs of when second email is received you can collect your product) anyways I waited and went to the Apple desk at fairview mall and the girl lady said to me that she can see that the item is purchased but unable to let it out maybe because of waiting on the preparation of the product so I thought okay I’ll com back in a while , I sat at the mall waited and at that time I started ringing customer service to see what’s happening after I went to Apple desk for a second to third time I was told to call 1800myApple which I did, they man spoke to said everything is fine I even had him on the phone to the lady at the Apple desk, still the lady said it don’t seems like it’s ready maybe something to do with my bank , which it wasn’t because Apple already took my money out my account. Cut a long story short, Apple had cancelled my order and didn’t even had the decency or respect to tell me or contact me to notify me of this, I waited so long and not one Apple customer service was able to tell me what the problem was and why was my purchase cancelled, each person told me something different because they don’t know s**t about s**t, If you Apple customer service reps don’t know how to do your jobs please just don’t go into this field of work  and waste peoples time or just educate yourself more on your product or policy producer and the way Apple works etch Apple have all these pc and systems  etc and not one person can tell me what the hell happened.

Why, as fate would have it, on this occasion we weren't video-recording her wrist walking from A to B.

"Today’s Apple products are tomorrow’s garbageWhere to begin? Apple used to sell high quality products, second to none. But over the past 10 years, the company has turned into a greedy conglomerate. Many would argue they were already a greedy conglomerate, but their latest practices are unforgivable. New iPhones don’t include a charger, or even a cord. Customers are forced to buy them separately, even though the iPhone cannot work without them. This would be the equivalent of buying an automobile, but having to purchase the gas tank and fuel pump separately. Earbuds disappeared years ago, along with the connector, prompting customers to buy outrageously priced wireless ones. Yet through all the things Apple has removed, their prices continue to skyrocket. The iPad 13 Pro Max sells for an outrageous $1,599. (Plus an additional $58 for that power adapter and charger that aren’t included.)For over five years, Apple has sold computers with defective, low-quality keyboards. Customers are now realizing that the storage inside them wears out after a few years, and cannot be repaired, at any cost. So Apple’s claim of being environmentally friendly is utter nonsense. After a few years, today’s new Mac will be completely worthless. Throw the whole thing away and buy another. Apple’s products can no longer be modified, upgraded, or repaired. They just wear out, turning into an environmental disaster.The last computer I bought was a used, 2015 model MacBook. It’s far superior to their new ones, in that it can be upgraded, and doesn’t need to be tossed into the trash after a few years. You won’t find many used Macs for sale in the future, as they’ll be dead and unfixable.I suppose if you have money to burn, buy a Mac.

"They steal people’s money and make refunds so time-consuming that many professional never ask for their pennies.It’s awful, I purchased a service through App Store, and it was not shown subscribed. So, I clicked again. They charged me twice for the same service. When I asked for refund they told me that they refunded me money. Probably, I will get some money in a few days. Since I was using services I claimed for the stolen money only but they canceled my subscription hoping they will return all the money charged. Now, same services are costing me £10/- more do not know what will they get by stealing people money. Anyways, we never have any medium to contact them to clarify things.

"I recently purchased a set of EarPods…I recently purchased a set of EarPods from the source in Fort St. John. I purchased them for my wife for Christmas and decided since we were travelling I’d give them to her early so she could use them on the flight home. On the flight home they kept falling out of her ear and We can’t seem to get them to stay in her ear. I called Apple care to talk to someone to see if this was a common issue and got told yes it’s a common issue and there’s no fix for it. They then explain to me that because I purchased them from a third-party like the source that there’s nothing they can do for me, that it’s not their product. Not their product… Pretty damn sure the Apple on the side of the box says otherwise. Now I’m stuck with a set of $200 headphones that my wife can’t use. Mary freaking Christmas honey, have some thing that you can’t use and oh by the way you’re stuck with them. Absolutely the worst service I’ve ever gotten.

"0 stars iphone 13 pro maxI bought the new iPhone 13 pro max 1 terabyte. It’s had so many issues. I bought this phone mainly for the camera but have had so many issues with the camera. The phone first started out having focus issues and sound on the video would have issues but went away. The videos will blur out a ton when taking the videos and lose focus half way through taking a video whether I’m moving or staying still. I thought it was something in the camera settings because people were telling me it will blur out backgrounds and stuff but it would blur everything in the video. When I first got the phone I wasn’t really using the camera a lot until I went and did something fun where I wanted to take videos and this is where I first noticed the issues. I’ve taken it to T-Mobile and since it was past the 2 weeks they can’t do anything and I had to go through Apple. Apple had me do some tests where it seemed fine then had me take it to Best Buy for tests but couldn’t see anything wrong but they could all see it was having issues when I showed them. I also shared my screen where two reps could both see on two separate occasions the blurriness issue as well as turning the camera on but the video and cinematic options are gone. I’ve also had issues with cropping. I think I got a dud phone and all they tell me is to reset network settings and restore phone back to factory settings where I need to delete everything off and then see if it still has the issues. The problem is that it does it sometimes and not others but it’s very inconvenient. They told me if it still has the issues I’d need to send it it but said I’d need to buy a temporary phone… do they not realize there are tons of fees with turning on a phone, SIM card, phone service, etc..???? Honestly I’m so disappointed with apple and their service and this garbage phone. Also they were suppose to have someone call me on Monday (they didn’t) but I got an email saying we missed you…. I found it funny because I was waiting on their call which never came in but they sent me an email saying they couldn’t reach me which wasn’t true because I waited for their call.

I have 8 apple products at home and none have been destroyed like this. There was no evidence of damage or impact to the glass or anywhere. I argued it’s a manufacturing defect and escalated. A customer care exec called and said he will check with the store ( liar). He called and said the store could find the site of impact. We went to store and a racist admin guy called Jake (at Rundle place adelaide) tried to explain the meaning of accidental to us!! He was so defensive when we asked if it could be a manufacturing defect. He said they are not investigative people. They only fix problems. We being doctors we get spoken by these people who have no clue about what they are doing or saying. The store guy said he is the boss and no one has revived any calls there. Full of fake liars who are trying to prove we are frauds when we purchase their products. Today called again when a very nice lady promised that this will be looked into. God knows when.

"Apple Constantly Disappoints MeAppleI have been in IT since it all began. I converted from PCs to Macs in 2005 and use Apple products constantly now. I keep them regularly updated to the latest models. As I do so I am continually dissatisfied with what I find. I could write a list of dislikes that would fill many pages. In the past few months I upgraded my iMac to a 2020 model from a 2014 model, expecting it to be a whiz-bang. It is not. My feeling is that I have not improved my situation one iota. That move cost me £2000. In the past week I upgraded my MacBook Pro from a 2018 model to a 2021 model and I feel the same. I thought  the new M1 chip would be transformational. It is not. There are too many points of dissatisfaction to list them all here, though I would do so if asked. Where has all the speed gone? The security aspects of setting up new hardware are horrendous. Even the once-simple process of migrating has become a nightmare. As an IT professional, I cannot see how ordinary people cope with all this! My MacBook Pro cost me £1800 and the cash back for a trade-in was £240. This is really not worth it. I have had constant issues with the OS - constantly being asked to put in passwords and security codes. This is all SO unsatisfactory. My son converted me to Apple by saying, “Dad, Apple just works!” He was right in 2005, but not any more.

Now this is where my issues started . I paid by part debit card so this money comes out of my account straight away and cash . Un be knowing to me the member of staff had issued me with part gift card /cash to be paid back into my account . I contacted the Apple store and spoke to manger who assured me that this could be changed into a credit note that could be transferred into my account … after hours and hours of talking to online mangers etc., they told me the money would be in my account ASAP . 9 days later they can’t find my credit note so they are going to make extremely unusual decision and give me a refund into my account . Now I’m told on the phone by Apple Belfast yes I’m getting a refund and it takes 3 to 5 working days to process .I now call the police as Apple have had my money £1049.00 interest free for 9 days . I have no confirmation at this minute where my money is ?How as a consumer do you think I feel when your on line team are telling me this is a disgrace how I have been treated .

This is not so !!!I spoke to a lovely gentleman by the name of Owen on Monday night who was delighted because he had found my credit note … he was a lovely gentleman who listened and helped me and commented how patient I was and also assured me this would be sorted .I’m not long home from the Apple Store in Victoria Square Belfast where I spent 3 hours . I came away in tears as the last 1hour 43 mins was spent talking to an on line manger who asked me what did I want him to d ???? So I told him what should have been done last week . Either wire me my money back into my account right away or do a bank transfer .If someone took £1049.00 CASH out of your account what would you do ?So he contacts the accounts team via email as the offices are closed for them to contact me tomorrow and do as requested .

(Keep in mind whole point is to take online course to retrain for different job, injury)I thought it was good, took awhile but opened with fingerprint.  Set up took long time and unfortunately I do have a life, 3 days later can not open. ????Back on phone, followed advice, now need iTunes to open.  What?  Back on phone.  I need an iPhone or working Mac with iTunes.  If I had that why this purchase?  Any cell phone?  No.  Just this $40 tablet I bought last year in WalMart.  It can not fill out a form.Can I send it in for reset NO!  But if I bought at WalMart In would get refund, right.  Agreement.  Imagine being the staff that makes WalMart(!) customer service looks good!So now have been scammed out of a months rent, and if you think is cheap, see heat bill to keep the only room with heat warm.I was so upset I was out of bed heaving 3 times last night, this has never happened before.  No retraining now?   I am fowl word with no lubricant, is that o.k. to say here?Working at WalMart was bad decision, and apple has the nerve to make them look good?  Is this some cult like lulu lemon?If I knew I had to drive 77 miles of sketchy mountain roads to use iCare would I have made these purchases?  Nearest apple store is 4 hours in summer, maybe.  Americans got military, Canadians have dept of hwys.Forcast says 20"" of snow on Saturday and is snowing now.  Not happening.  Next option?  Can I return and get refund?

I have a RING doorbell and scanned it from 9;30am thru 1:30pm even though there were 4 of us home. (Online on my account it said it was delivered) I called Apple to see what was going on. They said the person attempted to deliver it but no one was home so its being sent back. I told them about my RING doorbell cam and how 4 of us were home. They said they'd put it in for an investigation and I'd hear back. Next day, no one emailed or called me. I called and went thru 3 people. Last thing I was told was that they are processing for a new one to be sent to me and I'd get an email w/details.  Never happened. I called AGAIN on 12/12/21 & spoke to someone who was eating while he was talking and he told me it was being replaced & sent out, a supervisor will call me. I asked when and he said ""today"".

"Great Customer ServiceThis review is based on Apple’s help line. I ordered an iPad a few weeks ago, knowing that I would have to wait a while for it to come back in stock. However I didn’t realize that my card would not be charged until the item had shipped. Between the time I ordered the iPad and the time it took Apple to charge my account, my bank card had expired. I wasn’t able to change my payment method online so had to ring the help line. There I was connected with a lovely lady named Andrea who changed our payment method for us, and when there was an issue with verification on my banks end, waited on the line whilst we spoke to our bank in order to get our new card verified. She was so understanding and supportive in what was a very stressful situation (talking on the help line whilst simultaneously verifying our identity to the bank).

"Extremely poor customer serviceHaving spent so much on Apple products over the years I have decided to write an honest review of their very poor customer service.Why does a company sell an item described as water resistant yet refuse to honour any warranty regarding their so called water damage rules. The item in question is an iPhone 11 less than 12 months old which on request was sent to them. We received a message with a grainy photo saying a part needs replacement at the price of over £300. After a very lengthy phone call they are saying the volume switch has corrosion and seems to point to some sort of water damage? The phone has never been immersed or for that point anywhere near water and if you look online you will find a vast amount of similar problems with the iPhone 11. Obviously they didn’t get things right and are making loyal customers pay for it. I requested the phone back and what an incompetent service as the courier reported that insufficient address details were on the parcel. After a long telephone conversation with DHL, I was offered to go to pick the phone up from their Enfield depot. I turned up at 8pm and guess what no parcel, after an hour wait I was told to re attend the next morning in which I did only to waste another 2 hours as with the missing full address sent by Apple it made things very difficult. How about this the phone returned with deep scratches where it was opened and not put together back properly.

Privacy became a joke when Apple had governments have backdoor access to people's devices. Because Apple is headquartered in America, that country is an enemy to online privacy from mass surveillance. So, this is just another cut-throat corporation controlled by an Orwellian oligarchy. Especially when Chinese slave labor from China's dehumanizingly collectivistic country makes products that get sent to greedy Americans.Date of experience:December 04, 2021",1,Kordon,1,Portugal,2021-12-04 00:00:00.000000,alive arrogant financial new new specific backdoor privacy slave collectivistic sent,Positive

"Delivery and Customer Service NightmareI ordered an apple watch online today and they did not have it available for pick up in any of the Manhattan stores. I wanted to order it to be delivered to the store, so I can pick it up but there was no such option. A message popped up saying that I will be able to edit my delivery address after I purchase the order which I was not allowed to do without an Apple ID. I tried to create one, but it would not allow me to use my email for the registration, hence I couldn't create it. I chatted with someone who was useless, then called and was told they can't deliver my watch to the store and that's it - they ""just don't do that"". The person was extremely rude. At this point I have already explained the same situation to 3 different people and spent 2 hours on calls and chats with them while they were telling me I wasn't able to order for store pick up because the store didn't have the item which was something I was well aware of and explained to them every time but still had to listen to it every time I spoke to someone new. After this conversation I decided to chat someone and ask them to send the watch to my work instead. Of course this option was not possible either and I had to cancel the order and reorder it again.Horrible customer service, delivery rules that make no sense, bugs on the website - never again.Date of experience:November 26, 2021",4,Ralitsa Ivanova,1,United States,2021-11-26 00:00:00.000000,available pick able create useless rude different able aware new ask possible cancel,Positive

"to much stress, money taken and no PhoneI ordered a new phone Iphone 13 pro gold on 24 of October, it should arrive on 18 of November by DPD.I booked day off from work to wait for them as it should be delivered between 09:30 and 10:30. They never came. At 13:00 o clock, I 've tracked the parcel which says that I refused the parcel.I contacted Apple, and it resulted that on the shipping address wasn't the door number and the street... Has been updated and requested the re-shipment. Received another message saying that my phone will be delivered on Friday, I've changed the delivery for Saturday, as I knew I will not be home as I have to work and of course they never came, but I received another message saying that the phone will be delivered on Monday morning at 06:00 AM. On Monday morning they didn't come at 06:00 how they said but they come at 10:02. I wasn't in obviously but I was tracking the parcel, so I could see that my parcel has been delivered and received by the same person who supposed just to delivery it. I left work, I went home because I thought he left the parcel in front door, but there was nothing. I contacted Apple again, first operator (no name), after I explained and try to understand where my order is, aside the fact that the first question was if this phone was a gift or something special occasion which the question doesn't has nothing to do with my enquiry and especially when you are frustrated that you didn't received it at all, she kept asking me every minute if I was ok with her checking what was wrong with my order.... of course you can, that's why I am contacting you.... then at some point without any notice or something else the robot was asking me if I need help and that I will be in contact with a specialist.Second operator (George), specialist one.... after all the explanation I gave to him, said that my parcel wasn't delivered because of missing the first part of my address, tried to explain to him that actually on tracking number is said that has been delivered and received, I just seen that if I need help and I will be in contact with a specialist.Third one (Maria), explained everything from the, begging again, she said that she can see that her previous colleague requested a re shipment for me but she doesn't know when will be processed, approved and shipped and also she cannot send me any confirmation of the request. End of story, I don't have my phone which I paid 949£, I have no answers when I will have it.

They will purposely not send you a bill and then three months later you get this letter from your credit the credit department that your credit score has been degraded by 35% or points I have never missed a payment in my life on any bill I have ever had . And I had my phone payment set up for auto pay always receiving a text message 10 days prior to when the bill was due so when I did not receive a text message I guess I assumed that either the payment was being made or the phone was paid off not the case until I found out that they took 35 points off of my credit score for missing three payments I tried to get Apple to correct us and prove to them that I set this up as auto pay from the very beginning but no prevail now it will take me probably a year or so to get my credit score back up to 800 where it belongs I told them there would be no reason I would not pay that bill on time or info at any time . He kept making lame excuses I told them I am going to cancel the credit card and I will no longer buy Apple products has a long time Apple stock holder I am going to sell my Apple stock as well.

"Ever since ever owning an iphone I have…Ever since ever owning an iphone I have always had problems with the charging points. The charging points are TERRIBLE. After a while a lot of dust and dirt accumulated inside the charging point, and the phone no longer charges. This has happened with EVERY iphone ive ever owned, and I’ve had an iphone for the past 7-8 years now. It is utterly pathetic.I have also always had problems with the touch screen. If your hand gets slightly sweaty, or its raining and you get the slightest bit of water on your iphone dont even bother trying to type on it. The screen doesnt recognise your keyboard typing and it starts typing loads of random letters and numbers, and the phone often freezes. You have to lock and unlock your phone and the freezing issue stops. But this happens 10-20 times a day, and its got progressively worse the more iphones come out.Overall, I will never in my life buy another iphone again. Quality does not match the price tag, and even when something goes wrong that isn’t your fault you have to pay a ridiculous fee to get the device fixed.

"Worst Customer Service I Have Ever EncounteredI visited the Apple Store in Bath last Sunday and encountered the rudest shop assistant I think I have ever had the misfortune to meet.

My daughter, not knowing better, changed her apple id password AND her access pin, and promptly forgot them both (teenagers...). In trying to reset the id and password, the help line said said to do a factory reset and then do an account recovery process, which will take 24 hours... which is still too long... BUUUUTTT... what they didn't say is that the 24 hours is only the evaluation period. After that, its locked down for whatever of time they choose, in my case its 13 days!!! Called customer service and was basically told ""sorry about your luck, sucker"". My daughters iphone is in my family account in which I am the administrator. I am the Organizer, owner, purchaser, etc. I have proof that I purchased it and I have proof that it is in my possession and that it is not stolen. There is absolutely no reason they cannot easily verify it is not stolen, other than that would take too much effort on their part. So they are keeping it locked ""for my own good"".

"Don't buy!!!!! Horrible warranty and customer serviceMy brand new Iphone 12 Pro Max had a hardware failure in less than 6 months since purchasing it directly from Apple.com and it won't connect to wi-fi or bluetooth, so this suggests under the Consumer Rights that the issues can be considered as being there at the time of purchase. I did all the possible steps to have it replaced, but instead they put my existing screen on a different body, so it was like admitting that the phone needs to be replaced but they were saving the screen. How would they feel if their brand new computers would be dealt like this after having hardware issues in less than 6 months? Take the screen off and put it on a different hardware? After paying £1200, this is what I get!!! Customer service was very poor as well in Bluewater as shop was packed with people dealing or waiting for repairs! Disgusting!!! Worth mentioning that they've used all my mobile data to run their test as the phone was not connecting to wi-fi or bluetooth and they damaged my screen protection and wouldn't offer me a new one.

"Company is not able to give or receive phone calls, but demands them. The company is about 100 years behind the times and is not up to date with modern technologies such as how to use a phoneIn attempting to sign up for a simple payment processing service I found that Apple, Inc. seems to be particularly challenged specifically in the fields of telecommunications and technologies.  Matters that seem to be relatively simple and straight forward when dealing with any other business, from a startup small business on up to a Fortune 500 company, are apparently very difficult or impossible for Apple to accomplish.It appears that Apple is not familiar with elements of modern technology, specifically in regards to how to give and receive phone calls or communications over the internet.Of all of the companies I have dealt with for the past decade or so, the company which has shown itself to be the most technically challenged and behind-the-times in the fields of internet technology and telecommunications, is Apple, Inc.Specifically:1. I signed up online for an Apple developer account, which was the first step to getting a payment processing account.2. I then received an email stating that the application could not be completed without a phone call.  This is a dated technology (phone communications). Such dated technology is not usually needed by modern corporations familiar with 21st internet technologies used for long distance communications.  Even in the case where a face-to-face meeting is desired for verification purposes, we have numerous methods of accomplishing this which are far more advanced than telephones.3. Nevertheless, I set aside a time to call Apple, despite recognizing that this company is behind the times.4. When I attempted to contact Apple, I found that they had other issues.  There is no phone number to call.  The only way to contact them is to go online and submit a request for them to contact me.5. Despite this outdated technology and hassle, I input my phone number and waited for their call.6. I attempted this numerous times. On some occasions, my phone rang but when I answered and responded, I heard only silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I then received an email that Apple was ""trying to reach me.""7. I contacted Apple by email and requested to have their phone number so that I could call them, since they were not able to call me.8. Apple support then told me that they do not have a phone number to receive calls.  (Another indicator that this company is about 100 years behind modern times: they are demanding a phone call, but have no number.)9. I again made an appointment for Apple to call me.10. I arranged my schedule and made myself available for the call.  Again, the same pattern repeated. On some occasions, the phone rang, I picked up and answered, and heard silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I got an email saying ""we're trying to reach you.""11. I made another appointment.  I gave another number. I waited for the call.  The phone was sitting by me and did not ring.  There was no missed call. I received an email from Apple, stating that they had called and could not get through.I can see that Apple, Inc. is at least a few decades out of date.  It should probably get itself up to speed with modern technologies, such as how to use a telephone, and what internet technology is.  I am able to work with any other business, whether it is a bank or an ice cream shop.  I can give and receive calls and I can sign up for new services online.In the last 10 years or more, the only company I have encountered that is so technically challenged in the fields of Internet Technology and Telecommunications is Apple, Inc.Date of experience:November 10, 2021",12,Megan,1,United States,2021-11-10 00:00:00.000000,able give modern simple simple straight small difficult impossible familiar modern first modern familiar long numerous advanced outdated numerous able modern available modern able receive new last,Positive

Just annoying and frustrating.I think they know their devices sell so couldn't care less about service.I bought the laptop from them because I had it spec'd but everything else I would buy from any other retailer rather than apple.Terrible customer service experience.

"DON’T DO IMMEDIATE DELIVERY..I ordered something from Apple online. I chose immediate delivery and paid the extra fee as it meant that I was going to receive it the same day.I was keeping track of my order and who my driver was and that it was still being picked up. The Apple store it was at was across town. It takes at least 20 mins to get to my place. I refreshed it literally 5 mins after and saw that it was delivered. I went downstairs to confirm and it was not. I chatted with Apple and the person I was chatting said that it was delivered and since I didn’t get it, I would be issued a refund then that chat agent disconnected with me before I could ask other questions. So I called. This lady says that my order is still in progress and that it’ll be delivered some time today. She then transfers me to ‘Immediate delivery’ department and this agent says it was delivered and there wasn’t anyone there. I told him that literally it was 5 mins from when he was across town to when it was delivered, which is impossible in my city to do. Also, I was refreshing every 5 mins to make sure I wouldn’t miss it. I am issued a refund which will take 5-7 business day but still all that money that I had spent, for nothing and I have to wait a week for it come back.

But sometimes it’s just unnecessary what you do. Okay so last night I was just listening to music and then all of a sudden it stopped. I went to go look at my phone and it turned off. And so I shut it down all the way and I thought it was fine. But no, it wasn’t. It stopped working completely for an hour and I called apple for help. And yes they were indeed helpful. But because I didn’t have the money to backup what I had on my phone, I lost literally everything. And honestly I feel like it’s at the fault of apple.

"I have been cheated and disrespected by AppleI have purchased a MacBook 15' at the price of £2,660 from Birmingham store and after sometimes keyboard started playing up, I have sent it 3 times for repair which took over two months and eventually Apple said they cannot repair and they offered me a replacement with MacBook 16' as the 15' one was out of production. They didn't give me an option to choose between a full refund and replacement and they didn't mention anything about the price of the new MacBook (£2,199) at the time.I have received the new MacBook and after a month started having hardware issues and sent it twice for repair and eventually, Apple said they cannot repair it and gave me an option for replacement with the new MacBook(£2,499)  as the old model is out of production, and asked me to pay £200 as the new MacBook's price was higher than the old one. I needed a device so had to pay and they told me to get in touch with Apple support and raise your complaint. Which I did but then they said as transaction happened in the store I have to contact the store.I have been through a lot since purchasing this MacBook at a very premium price, send my devices for 5 repairs and stayed months without any device and yet replaced with another faulty machine and another replacement. I suffered a lot and the least APPLE should do was apologising and doing the replacement without charging me. I feel they are playing and throwing me like balls from store to customer service and from customer service to the store.I am very frustrated, I feel being cheated and I feel I wasted money and time and APPLE doesn't care.I am not happy with the way I have been treated.

"Take as long as you want and don't tell me you broke my phone!Today I went to Apple at 11:00am, My phone's battery kept draining after about 35 minutes of use. (Its an IPhone 8). On the website it didn't say anything about having to wait 5+ hours on a battery repair. Initially I thought that when you book for an appointment they would just do it straight away. They told me to come back at 1:10pm. Throughout the day I was exploring trying to pass time. I get there at 1:10pm and they told me to come back at 2:15pm. I was so annoyed just because I told my friend I was going to come over so I had to postpone that and do a bit more exploring. I get there at 2:15pm on time and they come out and tell me ready at 3:15pm, at this point I started to get pretty angry and asked them why its taking them so long to do a 15 minute job? Of course they used the Covid excuse. I then get there at 3:15pm and this young woman (looked like she just escaped from primary school) came out and told me to come back at 4:15pm laughing under her breathe because she thought I couldn't tell the time. I told her to shut up and went into the store and asked this old lady where my phone was, I waited about 5 minutes and she came out with a new phone saying that the people broke the phone and gave me a new IPhone 8.

"Don't expect a refund under any circumstances.Over the month sI have had a series of unauthorised payments to Apple App Store mad through my Apple account. Apple swear blind that these were authorised by an iPhone 6 that belonged to my daughter. I took the phone, switched it off and locked it a my safe....the unauthorised activity continued for a while until I removed the iPhone 6 and my payment method from the account. A few payments were refunded, then the money taken back for most of them, leaving me £170 out of pocket. A few months later it started up again. No payment method had been entered on the account and yet my debit card was chaged another £169. This would have been much higher if I had not alerted my bank and had payments to Apple blocked. Apple Support was useless. Their agent Noel even put forward the theory that someone was accessing my Apple account, despite me changing the password several times and adopting 2 stage verification, entering my debit card details, making purchases, then deleting the debit card number until the next time. I asked how this was possible given the 2 stage verification, frequent change of password etc.No explanation was offered. I next spoke to Marcel who had a further bizarre theory that my daughter's old phone may have been cloned. This still did not answer the tricky question of getting past the 2 stage verification on my account. Next I was put through to a manager called Nicky. She was  sympathetic and superficially helpful. It turns out that Apple refund requests are not dealt with by humans but by an algorithm. In my case one refund would be approved and the next 6 denied. In classic Little Britain fashion 'the computer says no'. All Nicky could do was to suggest I take it up with my bank. Apple plays snakes and ladders with banks, giving money back with one hand, when challenged, then recharging the account a few days later when the computer says no again. It is like communicating with the members of some strange cult whose sole aim is to relieve you of your hard earned money. I have lost count of the number of hours I have wasted over this issue in the past 4 months. It seems that Apple banks on you giving up any refund claim or suggestion that their system is not secure, through shere frustration. A truly dreadful company that I will never deal with again.Date of experience:October 18, 2021",31,Gareth Woods,1,United Kingdom,2021-10-18 00:00:00.000000,refund si mad locked safe removed card useless password several stage debit debit card next possible frequent bizarre old tricky past next nicky sympathetic helpful algorithm classic little strange sole hard secure dreadful,Negative

"Zero customer serviceZero customer service. Had a problem with phone recognizing battery as Apple. After calling apple and going through the testing they sent me to Best Buy. Best Buy at first tried to get me a new phone, but Apple would not allow this. They then tried to fix it , since he had the part right there, but Apple denied that. Apple made them send the phone to them which could take 21 days. It’s a F’ing battery on a brand new phone. Quickest, simplest fix should have been a no brainer. Not with Apple.

"Apple World Trade Center store—employee…Apple World Trade Center store—employee Chris, supposedly a manager mishandled harassment against woman and apologized to male harasser. Such is the state of the U.S. where even Apple employees act irrationally and lack good judgement. How it happened: I waited patiently on a bench by the wall (nothing behind us) for over an hour with Keem, an Apple employee to cancel a 2yr. AppleCare coverage when a man insistently and repeatedly took pictures of us. We knew as I would move away from the man’s camera range and he would re-position. I asked him to please stop taking pictures and the man reacted aggressively and kept taking pictures of me. I reached out to the nearest employee and explained briefly only to get “I am with another customer right now” twice as if I was just doing a simple purchase—which part of harassing did he not understand. Then Chris came in and apologized to the harasser instead. Neither the employee I asked for aid nor Chris did anything about this leaving the harasser to feel empowered. These are the men on our country ladies! Run for the heels! Steve Jobs most be turning in his grave over the cowardly, mediocre lack of due care at the new Apple. Shame on you Apple, Chris and World Trade Center store! I can only hope that when a harasser comes after your mother, sister, daughter, wife, or girlfriend that someone has more decency than you to stand up for them and seek to protect NOT throw them to the wolves!*This feedback exempts Keem and Devin—The only the employees who had presence of mind to understand what was happening and acknowledged.Date of experience:October 03, 2021",7,Namastemother…..,1,United States,2021-10-03 00:00:00.000000,harassment good simple mediocre due new sister seek understand,Negative

"Apple Joke BarSince last Friday I’ve been on the phone with them about my Apple Pencil second generation which started melting by itself without being attached to the IPad pro I have. Two days ago they told me over the phone that the technicians concluded that my pen and also IPad which has melting marks on the side where the pen charges, are caused by DUST!!!!! Today because of my persistence I had a Genius Bar appointment and after ten minutes they said that there is nothing wrong with my pen which has burning marks. I had to insist and ask who is going to be responsible if I continue to use my pen as they have advised me and maybe it will continue to melt or melt my IPad. The Apple representative still tried to make me go away until a point when he said that he can keep my pen for security check which takes a week or basically leave my old pen with them and buy a new one with 10% off.

Apple products come with a 1 year warranty. After using my laptop for about 6 months my screen started flickering. I have sent in my macbook 5 times for repair.

I told them that i cannot be without a laptop because I am a student who unfortunately has to do school virtually everyday.

We actually own several of their products and as a result of how they handled my recent communications, they appeared deceptive and looked for any excuse as to why they could not assist.

"Trash Macbook Pro 2018 15inch And Apple In GeneralI'm going to not talk about how its usability to price ratio is low comparing to PCs and jump into specific aspects that annoy me:1. Frequent useless updates that tend to remove and hide features. Old tutorials that are just months old often lead you to nowhere. There was a setting in Pinyin Chinese that allows the mac to ignore the letter 'g', after the update, I can't find it (I went to the Apple Store and they still can't find it).2. Disorganized file structure. It may seem clean at first, but if you are trying to delete all files related to a software like Xcode, you will find there are hundreds of them laying in many different folders. You can delete some of them. For others you can't even move them. And the Apple technician told me to delete all of them.3. Equating unreliable new features as innovation. For whatever reason, my touchbar flashes about every 1 minute. And there is the butterfly keyboard that jams and typessss several characters at a time.4. Slow and unprofessional support. So I tried to use the Apple Care to solve some of those issues. I tried to chat with them online 1st but they are not specialized in Xcode (my 2nd pt). I scheduled and went to an Apple shop and that person is still not specialized. They said they would call back and email me, but absolutely nothing happened. I ended up factory reset my mac after spending hours trying to do what I said in pt 2.5. Child porn iPhone news. No elaboration needed.6. Frequent slowing down of speed (for mac) accompanied by loud sound of the fans and heating up. Sometimes random weird stuff would happen if you haven't restarted your mac for some time like Finder deciding you have no permission to open and change files you created. It is not a secret that Apple slows down old models before releasing new models of iPhone.7. Doesn't support most games.8. Bluetooth feature (between mac and iPhone) that doesn't work most of the time. It all depends on the mood of the mac if it lets your iPhone find it and airdrop a file.9. App issues. For example, Textedit issues like when you created a table and tried to enter something it becomes like this ""imgur. c0m Slash a Slash BOhpEtA"". Another example: Xcode prompted me to auto fix a line in the C++ library (not my own code) and proceeded to tell me I can't do that.Date of experience:September 23, 2021",1,Someone,2,United States,2021-09-23 00:00:00.000000,trash pro usability low specific annoy frequent useless old old file clean first delete many different technician delete unreliable new several slow unprofessional child frequent loud random weird mac open secret old new mac airdrop table tried fix library,Positive

"Absolutely disgraceful company to deal…Absolutely disgraceful company to deal with, I purchased a brand new Apple Macbook Pro in June 2020 at a cost of just under £1300 from John Lewis Partnership who offered a 3 year warranty.At the end of January 2021, the Macbook screen was black with coloured vertical lines when I turned it on. It was returned to Apple who replaced the screen.In August 2021, the same thing happened. I used the PC in the morning and then left it on the table whilst I walked my dogs. On my return, I turned the PC on to find the same fault that occurred before. I called and spoke to Apple who tried to fix the problem over the phone. The attempt was unsucessful, Apple said that because the Macbook was now 14 months old, it was outside of the guarantee but it seemed there was a hardward problem. The Macbook was returned to JLP. I've just received a call from JLP to tell me that an Apple engineer has inspected the Macbook and found a 'pressure crack' in the screen causing an LCD bleed and this is not covered by their guarantee. The crack could have been caused by extreme heat or being banged. It was neither - no-one was at my home. The person I spoke to tried to insinuate that my labradors could have jumped on the table and damaged the laptop!! This is total nonsense, they can't get to the table and were out with me. The PC was also in a protective case to preserve the outer case from scratches.I live alone, use my PC carefully. I've used MacBooks for over 20 years and never had a problem yet this one has developed the same fault twice in 6 months.If this is the quality to expect from Apple it's time I bought a different make - I also purchased an Apple IPhone at the same time and that went wrong within 10 days.

"AppleCare+ REMOVED BY A minor on my Apple FamilyToday I spoke with AppleCare+ sr rep Jason let me know I was not able to speak to his manager or other person to complain about/ make suggestions for AppleCare+. I am family organizer and super mom of my family. I pride myself in making sure things are taking care of for the kiddos and when I noticed that the apple care was not active for some reason I contacted apple… 3 calls later I get Jason (sr rep). Though he agreed that it made sense he could provide no email or address where I could write in nor could I speak with someone and that he would disconnect because we did not agree with him and there was nothing else to be done. Though I asked multiple times and he agreed with my point and my concerns and that I was not impolite he still hung up on me. I had also received different info from the 3 other Applecare+ reps adding to my frustration. I simply asked Why should the children on my family account be able to remove AppleCare+ without my consent since it is my investment and I am paying for it… in truth we do not know how it got removed And I have no choice but to accept this … I should still be able to give a suggestion or complain about my experience with AppleCare+ To help others either be aware or to help Apple improve it …instead I have one of your employees hang up on me and tell me to have a great day at that … this was my absolute worst experience with APPLE. By the end of the call I told Jason that I would like to speak with his manager to complain about the fact that he stated since we don’t agree he would disconnect the call … he said no “the buck stops here”If I buy a vehicle, a computer, cell phone service or any other thing for my children and I choose to put insurance on it my children never have the opportunity to call and remove this insurance BECAUSE THEY ARE CHILDREN AND DO NOT SUPPORT THEMSELVES but somehow with AppleCare+ they can do that I think that this is a flaw and this is something that should be looked into to correct.

"MAC BOOK PROMAC BOOK PROI think this will be my last laptop purchase from Apple.Expensive product for what it is!First, WHERE ARE the usb ports! Sorry!?My computer looks like a tarantula with external extensions sticking out all over the place. Really handy when you need to quickly put the laptop in your bag, because yes it is a laptop. No?Has the product been tested? If yes. By who?How do I charge my iPhone? How do I insert the memory card of my pro camera? No question ...This product is a shame! Because when you see the competitive market. Where is Apple? We expect from this luxury product a minimum of functionality at the height of its Design. Isn't that the minimum? What to simplify our life?I always buy Apple, but I had to write all of these points because it's really making fun of the consumer:- Very nice closed object, the coating of which still leaves far too many traces and fingerprints. A square of fabric suitable for the maintenance of this luxury product should be provided.- Screen light adaptation is not subtle enough. It goes through shades of green, red, blue and yellow every second. It’s disturbing when you are working. The variation is poorly managed.- The fixed front icon of ""managing windows open in the background"", in my opinion the most useful tool, has disappeared. You have to go look for it in the touchscreen sidebar- The tactile sidebar is too small for the fingers (I am female). It’s a genuinely useless, time-wasting gadget. It’s really giving crumbs when Apple can do better than that. In this case, the entire keyboard should be tactile, including the customisable sidebar (example: touch bar for managing “fixed icon” windows).The touchscreen should be a highlight expected in 2021, for an Apple product with the integrated 3D option, justifying the price.Thank youDate of experience:August 29, 2021",11,Audi,1,United Kingdom,2021-08-29 00:00:00.000000,last sorry tarantula external handy insert competitive minimum simplify fun many square suitable light subtle green red yellow second front open useful small useless entire touch icon,Positive

"Airpods mic issueWas given Airpods for Christmas, really liked them however didn’t get much use out of them because of Covid. However, once started using them, noticed they were not charging properly. They replaced them under the warranty and got a new pair in Feb/March which appeared to work. However, when I tried to use them for a call, nobody could hear me. I raised this with Apple and they said I should go in the store which I only managed to do this month given the Covid situation. The store said they could see water damage and that I would have to pay £65 per pod to replace. I explained that I have not had them long and hardly used them, only for gym.  They said that sweat from the gym can cause it.Given my previous issues with them and that I have hardly used them, I spoke to customer service who said there was nothing they could do and that I would have to pay that to either fix them or get new ones. When I tried to escalate it, she said that that there was nothing further they could do and nobody would contact me about it. She hung up midway through the call.I am shocked that after 3 months of having this new pair that “water damage” can impact them from occasional gym usage. If this is the case, then this should be made clear in their advertising. It also should not be £65 each to repair them (they said this would be the cost without actually looking at the issue properly).

"Battery replacement, Apple Store, Princes St., EdinburghI had organised and booked a slot in the Edinburgh Apple store after requesting a battery replacement for my iPhone 5s, and turned up at the proper time after an hours ‘bus journey.  After taking information which could have been taken beforehand by email, I was then told yes it needs a new battery but we don’t have one in stock, so one would need to be ordered and I’d have to book another slot.  As you can imagine, I was not happy with this and I found it unacceptable that a second visit would be needed, given it was highly likely a battery would be required, so I told them not to bother.  I went across the road and got a replacement fitted for £5 less within an hour.

"Apple is incompetentI went into today thinking that apple, a computer and phone company could easily get me a new phone and transfer my Apple ID from my broken phone that won’t turn on to their newest model of the 12. Thinking I could just make an appointment on their website, something a tech giant should be able to figure out, I was met with a security screen that asked for me to log into my Apple ID to make an appointment. To my surprise, my quest for getting a new phone required a verification code sent to my phone that I was trying to fix. I then had my dad call to make an appointment so that I could get in as soon as possible.  So today I went in and got my new phone. After paying over 1000$ I left the store only to find out that they again had changed the charging port for the usb but this time the other end and made me return to buy a wall port that could accommodate it. So more money down the drain. Once my phone was charged, it asked me to log onto my Apple ID which yet again, required me to put in a verification code sent to a phone that won’t turn on. At this point, I don’t know if Apple even knows what technology is supposed to do: Make life easier for people. After a lot more back and forth and getting no where, I was being told to buy another thing. At this point, I told them that if they don’t get this phone open, I was returning the phone and getting an android. It was only until then that they finally got me a working phone. While I am happy I can use my phone now, it is still extremely difficult for me to understand how a tech giant could be so incompetent on a phone they invented.Date of experience:August 16, 2021",1,Benjamin Spiegel,1,United States,2021-08-16 00:00:00.000000,new appointment able appointment new fix possible new wall open android happy difficult understand,Positive

This worker's supervisor, Ben, stated that since 1 year of warranty has passed they can only repair it at my own costs (basically worse and entirely different story than what his colleague said minutes ago).Obviously, Apple Amsterdam doesn't know the basics of marketing, that customer is always right and secondly Ben thinks that we pay 220 euro to use a product only for a year and also he offers a different solution to the problem (ask me to pay for Apple's factory defect). They speak about warranty while they sell defective items to Apple customers to force us to spend the same money every year. As a person who owns almost all types of Apple products, I am not going to spend a cent on Apple products especially in Amsterdam anymore. Given that the same exact defect happened to me with the same item version, this makes me also question the originality of the items Apple store sells in the Netherlands.Date of experience:July 31, 2021",1,Tina,1,Netherlands,2021-07-31 00:00:00.000000,defect second new different different ben different defect speak defective spend exact defect question,Positive

"APPLE CON -SOFTWARE 'GLITCH'After trying to upgrade my software, my phone would no longer connect to wifi. I spoke with technical support and followed all their instructions which did not resolve the issue.When I took my phone into Apple Store on Regent's Street I was immediately told there was nothing that could be done and then bulldozed into buying a new phone for £500. This new phone does nothing more than my 8 Plus and is in faact more fiddly. I've had to spend hours of my time on the phone to banks trying to re-set up apps and lost loads of data and passwords. In short it's been a waste of time and money and extremely frustrating.I don't understand how a technical product such as an Iphone which was working absolutely fine can suddenly stop connecting to wifi, rendering it useless. It appears to be a CON in order to get money from customers who haven't upgraded their phone in a while.

Fast forward to the next day and I still had not received it. I contacted support about this false advertisement and requested my gift card.

"AVOID AT ALL COSTSAVOID AT ALL COSTSAVOID AT ALL COSTS! I am sorry WAS a loyal Apple customer! I owned the latest apple phone! Latest ipad pro 12.9! MacBook Pro Touch! Latest air pods! Several Apple watches! Latest Apple pencil! And 2 weeks ago my partner purchased a hermes apple watch online to be given a delivery date of today and the day after to receive a tracking alert to say that the item had been collected in China and to select alert options which we did and then nothing for nearly 2 weeks & no change in the tracking status so we called DHL Express who quite honestly admitted it didn't look good and that it appeared that since being collected from China it had completely disappeared! No scans at all & that we should immediately make Apple aware that they needed to immediately begin an investigation! Called Apple and spoke to several advisers & a manager & none of them would have it at all insiting they had tracking info that stated it was DEFINITELY going to be delivered to me on the 26th July (which DHL Express were shocked to hear as their systems were more detailed & they couldn't find that information) I argued & argued & argued and they insisted it would arrive with me today! I even had a manager named Anneget say she was taking ownership of this & would keep us fully informed needless to say that was another lie because not only did she not 'keep us informed' but she also ignored all our emails requesting an update on the status! 🤦🏻‍♀️ So when it hadn't arrived today and I couldn't get a response from Anneget I rang Apple and first call they cut me off after asking how we help you then went through a real rigmorole to speak to another woman called Sophia for her to say 'I don't know why DHL are being so negative as I can see it is on track to be with you today!' At which point I asked her where was the last place this item was located for her to look again & say oh I need to escalate this as your not receiving this item today? What the??? She had just insisted that I would seconds before just like the rest of them had all week! Anyway when I got annoyed at this and dared to ask have Apple outsourced the customer care as in the past I had been put through to a call hub in either England or Usa she then switched on me and said 'oh right is this just because I'm not English then? Is that the problem yeah? NO! The problem is Apple have taken £1400 for an item they have not delivered and not just that but been downright rude & unhelpful over it too! And told lie after lie after lie!

"Authorized Apple Repair Centers Keep Your Replaced Laptop PartsMy 2019 MacBook Pro was getting power but would not boot up recently (July 2021). I had it repaired by an authorized Apple repair center because the laptop was covered under warranty. The Apple store rep did mention the repair may erase my data (not all of it was backed up); however, they never mentioned that I would not get any of my old parts back! Also, the laptop was returned in under a week which leads me to believe they never even attempted to retrieve my data from the hard drive or may have no way to do it. I wouldn't know because none of those details were mentioned on the product repair summary slip returned with my laptop! This is a problem because the hard drive (which stores sensitive data) is now welded to the logic boards on the new Apple laptops (the old Apple laptops internally stored them separately). I did not learn this until recently that the hard drive is attached to the logic board on the new laptops and all housed together. But why would they keep the old part(s) and not send it back to me, the customer and rightful owner of the part, nor tell me why? Perhaps if I had received my old part(s) back then I could have retrieved my data! Since several parts are ""all in one"" now, how do I know what was broke and what was ok?? They certainly never provided me those details. Not to mention, what did the ""authorized Apple repair center"" do with my old logic board/hard drive?? That hard drive contained sensitive financial and personal data on it, so why not tell the customer what happens to their old parts, especially parts that house sensitive data?? I did contact Apple support and they basically said once you sign off to have the repair done, they get to keep your old part(s) and erase your data and never give any details as to what really happened or what went wrong! At least with a car repair, the customer can request to get their old parts back!

"I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT SCARY NIGHT BECAUSE OF A LIVE AGENT ONLINE!Tonight I spoke with a live agent online regarding a very serious security issue with my I cloud. She refused to read carefully what my issue was, she kept sending me links to change my apple id which I kept telling her I had already changed 3 times and someone would change it again. Then she asked if I used my device for work. I said yes and she said talk to your job administrator which I said it was my personal device and not related to my job. I just used it to help myself in my job, she kept repeating talk to your job administrator, then I informed her that I was an apple care customer and requested that she schedule an appointment for me. She asked for my  serial number then said she didn't recognize it as an apple product and that she could not help me anymore. I said my problem is with iCloud and gave her my Mac serial number , then she said we chatted about an iPad , so she couldn't help. this conversation had gone on very long with her not reading or understanding my problem, and sending more links that had nothing to do with my issue. I told her I would report her and she sent a link for feedback about apple products not service. I hung up on her and scheduled a call back myself on the site which I had asked her to do. I made screenshots of our conversation and I intend to take this further because she did not offer any help at all and she did not try to understand the problem, and she refused to even schedule a call back. while being very rude. she kept talking about my job, I told her my job uses dell, it has noting to do with my apple iCloud and she replied that she had worked with dell. I said I hope now you are working with apple and that you will try to help me. But she sent another link showing hoe to reset my password. This wasted about 2 hours or more of my time and was absolutely unacceptable. I had also told her that I was trying to do a factory reset but it wouldn't take and she sent me a link to permanently delete everything from my I cloud.

"Apple died with Steve JobsSigh....I have been an Apple supporter & user my entire life since in my early 30s. There was a time I was ready to get a tattoo of the logo on my heart to show my devotion. I used to sell them to people as an Apple seller with 150% belief that it was the BEST computer on earth. Today not so much.I bought a brand new iMac retina 27"" desk top from Apple.ca with upgrades which cost me 8K when said and done. It took over 2 weeks to get delivered (from china!) But I thought worth the wait. Once here I unboxed it, turned it on to install my basic needs, email plus Adobe  creative cloud. About 30 minutes of use, before I shut it off, unplugged it and put it aside as I set up my new office space to accommodate it. 2 weeks later when my office was ready I plugged it in and....DEAD. No sign of life what so ever. And the fun begins!I called Apple care which I had bought for an additional 350 dollars. Spoke to individual who made me do a bunch of useless plug in and unplugging steps over and over even though I repeatedly told them it does not turn on. I finally was connected to the nearest Apple store near me which is a ferry ride away as I live remotely. First thing the person says is can you tell me what the issue is with your iPhone??!! After explaining that I have been on the phone for over an hour discussing my iMac not my ijunk, they tell me because I bought it on line the Apple store will not be able to do the return! So I called Apple care again and spoke to new person and explained my situation. They refer me to take it in to an Apple retailer, made me an appointment for next morning with an apple'genius'...code for MORON in actuality.  I explained to them that I live remotely and will not be happy if I take a ferry in just to walk in and have some pimple faced 15 year old stare at me like a deer in headlights. Oh no sir I assure you that will not happen, you're all set. So next morning I pack up the piece of junk and ferry in to my appointment with apple moron. Appointment is at 11:20, I arrived at 11:22, Apple moron shows up at 11:40, was sitting in back jerking or updating his FB status, who knows. Then I get the confused look as to why I'm there. Then explains that because I bought it on line, he can't do the return! Just as I knew it would go down, it did! Called Apple care from my car, after 1 hour of speaking to someone who was actually competent, explained that I bought it online, and was told by Apple store that I was not able to return it. The Apple care person assured me that was not true, put me on hold, called the nearest Apple store to me that was 15 minutes away and set up my return. She gave me the name of the employee to ask for when I got there. I walked in, asked for person in charge of my return, was told she was not there and had left that morning....even though Apple spoke to them 15 minutes ago!!! Why lie about it? Then was told but maybe I can help you, what seems to be the issue? After 45 minutes of explaining my horrible experience I finally got my 8K back! I am officially done with this garbage company.

"iPhone 8 vs iPhone 12 water resistanceI carry an iPhone 8 for work and an iPhone 12 for personal. On Thursday July 8, 2021 I was working outside most of the day with both phones in my pocket. Raleigh, NC was experiencing heavy rains due to a tropical storm. On Friday night, 7/9/21, the display on the iPhone 12 went out. Went online and made an appointment at an Apple store for 7/10/21.The agent determined that it was water damage and offered the following solutions: 1) pay $449 for a repair/replacement. 2) buy a new phone starting at $399 and up based on various models. 3) pay $449 for a replacement iPhone 12 and then add 2 year warranty for $199 with a $99 deductible. However, even though I would be getting a new iPhone 12, the warranty would be retroactive to the original date of October 2020.If I spent $449 for a new iPhone and compared extended warranty to no extended warranty it would be like this if I had another incident with water damage:Warranty: 15 months coverage (now thru Oct 2022) $199 + $99 deductible = $298No warranty: $449 for replacement iPhoneMy argument was that the iPhone 12 has a higher water resistance rating than does the iPhone 8. In addition, the water resistance decreases over time. The iPhone 8 is several years old and the iPhone 12 is less than a year old. Yet, both phones were exposed to the rain storm while in my pocket. The iPhone 8 is still working and the iPhone 12 is not.The Apple agent stated that Apple does not get into the reasons or circumstances of how the water damage occurred, only that there is water damage and therefore it is not covered under their warranty. My counter that it appears that there was a manufacturing defect since the higher rated iPhone 12 was not as water resistant as the much older iPhone 8 was met with Apple policy of water damage = no warranty and no chance of manufacturing defect ever.Date of experience:July 11, 2021",16,Mark,1,United States,2021-07-11 00:00:00.000000,personal working outside heavy due tropical new various deductible new original new extended deductible several old old warranty rated resistant much,Positive

"Apple Is Now Run By Greedy Adult ChildrenAm I the only one who thinks that Apple is introducing malware or bugs to a perfectly fine software? Are these bugs designed to spy on us? I really don't get it. Ever since Steve Jobs died, it seems that Apple is run by greedy adult children who no longer innovate, but infiltrate. It took a bit getting used to iOS Big Sur, (being a fan of the older 80s & 90s software & even iOS Catalina) but I started to get along with it. The software was fine. Now, suddenly without me doing anything to introduce malware to my computer, I think Apple did so purposefully (since it is all digital and accessible by WiFi) just so they could spy to see what else they can force-sell to me. It is sickening. My computer will not react normally anymore. It has become slower than a turtle, and I swear I did not download anything malicious. I even turn off the WiFi whenever I am not on. Sometimes, the darn WiFi will turn itself back on right in front of my eyes. I am not kidding, nor have I lost my marbles. I am a straight shooter & clear-headed. I used to fix vector scopes and beta max and VCR players for fun, so I am mechanically inclined and know those bells and whistles. I also keep up to date with the latest workings of IT.

It used to be the priority was to get your equipment back to you as soon as possible. Now it seems like the priority is to get it to a depot and then begin asking the owner about additional out of warranty cosmetic repairs they might want to authorize.

"Applecare+ shamblesBought a iPod touch for daughter's birthday with applecare+ protection.  Within a couple of weeks she dropped it from a low height (60-80cm above the floor) and despite being in an expensive apple protection case it developed a hairline crack.  I called up and arranged the return under Applecare+, the box was received and it was sent off to apple for repair.  So far, so normal...A couple of days later I received an email back saying that it was being sent back to me unrepaired and that it was not eligible for applecare+ repair.  I called up and no one at apple really seemed to know what was going on as it's a different company that deals with repairs.  I was told that the iPod might have have been deemed beyond economic repair.  The next day the iPod arrived back to me, with the same hairline crack to the screen.  I called up apple again and asked why it had not been repaired under applecare+ - again, total confusion, much waiting on the line and generally no real idea.  All that happened was I was told a new box would be sent and I would have to go through the same process once again, this time with a contact at apple I could call if the same nonsense happened again.Ridiculous waste of time.  Once upon a time you would accept apple's premium prices because of the quality of the service and aftercare.  This does not appear to be the case.  I would estimate I've spent about 3-4 hours trying to resolve what should have been a straightforward repair thus far thanks to failure in apple''s processes & systems.  Not acceptable.  At no point did anyone at apple offer a goodwill gesture / compensation for the hassle and the time I've had to waste on this matter.I had been considering upgrading my MBP to a M2 chip MBP later in 2021 when they are released.  On the basis of my experience dealing with apple support I will be reconsidering that decision.EDITHaving been given cast-iron assurances that the first return of the item without being repaired under applecare+ was a mistake I have just received notification that they are sending back the iPod again to me, once again unprepared.  I have *literally* spent 4 hours on calls to apple support who just seem as bewildered as me as to what's going on.

"Never buy apple productsI'm an android user yet my mother who has now passed used to buy apple. She purchased an iPad 2 months before passing away. It is locked. It was in my father's possession and 2 years later we are still unable to use it. Having spoken to countless people in the technical team and lodged complaints over several weeks ago, no one has contacted me regarding the matter. I followed up again only to find my complaint had not been recorded and followed up again. One technician said that it was a software issue and that you had to keep uploading until it recognised the document. It took one person 20 go's and on the 21st go it recognised the same receipt document to unlock the device. The fact that Apple won't recognise that they use faulty software as an IT company is ridiculous, wasting customers time trying to get their devices to work. I now have an ipad that my father bought for my mother for £409.00 that he can't use and only got two months use out of. Having been sent in circles, every other matter of resolving her affairs have long been resolved yet we have got no where with this one. We've provided receipts, bank statements and all the evidence they've asked for and they stlll won't recognise my father as the rightful owner using the excuse of not wanting to compromise the privacy of my mother. How is compromising privacy if we want the device reset. We've offered a copy of the death certificate which they've declined. So we're sitting with a dead ipad unable to use it, apple won't respond to complaints or anything. Gone are the days where you pay a lot more than Android for 'customer service'. All I can advise is to stay clear of this company.

"No after care serviceApple have operated a substandard service for many years and today takes the biscuit.   There is no formal way of making a complaint.In November I booked an appointment at the covent garden Genius bar. In the booking the model, serial number and issue was logged.  I went and cued for my appointment to be told the model was too old for the repair.  I wasted over 3 hours travelling and waiting at the height of a pandemic.  I raised a compliant and emailed the store directly.  No response.Yesterday, whilst out my 4 months old lightning mini-jack adaptor stopped working.  Although I could show it was not working and had the receipt, my only option was to buy a new one as someone from the genius bar needed to confirm it was not working.   It has taken 2 hours today to go round with the only option of booking over the phone a genius bar appointment to prove the adaptor is not working.Making a complaint is all but impossible.Shocking after care, with a view that their consumers time is completely expendable - i was shunted around 3 different people - none of whom seem equipped to deal with the issues adequately.Date of experience:June 19, 2021",16,James,1,United Kingdom,2021-06-19 00:00:00.000000,substandard many formal booked appointment serial old height compliant old new expendable different,Positive

"To whom it may concernTo whom it may concern,I am so deeply frustrated with the level of customer service provided to me. You, Senior managers, are contradicting on their levels of advice and customer service. I called Thursday, May 27th, 2021, in regards to an order I placed for an air pod repair.  Repair ID # A494547235. I called the day I ordered this product in order to cancel the repair because I found my air pod… The customer support contacted Senior management who said she would reach out to the carrier and stop the shipping on the product (Please pull the recording on this conversation, she never told me that I would need to refuse the package.) How can I refuse a packing that you never sent me a shipping email for, even after stating you would? The product was never in shipping mode as of Thursday the 27th. I assumed that the senior manager handled this. Until today June 1st, 2021, when I received the package when I got home. No one signed for it, they just left the package. (Hard to refuse something you don’t know is coming, let alone never receive a shipping email for). I thought the senior manager handled it. Well today I called and spoke to Trey, who basically told me there will be no refund, even after told by the other senior manager that I would receive a refund. No brand loyalty. I got told on two occasions to sell the product on ‘eBay’. So much for Apple loyalty. Why have loyal customers who buy from apple, when you’re sending them to EBAY? Trey the senior manager from today, was kind and apologized, but apologies does not stand by customer support and is inappropriate when there is zero resolve and will not let you speak to another person. As a customer who has spent nearly 10k on apple products in the last few years, I’m astonished in how you treat customers over $95. Customer service doesn’t matter to you, and brand loyalty must not be important if I can buy knock offs from EBAY and you support that. It’s very upsetting.

"Apple fails to match the level of customer support with the beauty of their productsSexy products, but as many other electronic goods nowadays, they are programmed to fail, as soon as the warranty expires.The difference in this case is, Apple products and maintenance parts are extremely expensive, so the customer support should be flawless, to say the least.My first and hopefully last experience with Apple Service was an awful one.First off, when you want to approach them for any human interaction, you can only book a “call back” on their website, which, btw, is coming on the language settings defined by the browser you are booking this service from. I happened to be temporarily in Germany, so the language was not my native one, anyway, this is not the worst thing yet.As a former happy customer of an iMac 27”, iPad and lately a Macbook Pro 15”, I used to believe Apple service would have been one of the best, in any case in line with the nicely refined products they are producing. Nothing could prove to be more wrong than this assumption. Apple is clearly enjoying a position of monopoly by keeping pushing nice looking hardware on a thirsty market, neglecting the long-term consequences of a bad customer care.Now, to the point in case: my Macbook Pro is not even 3.5yrs old and became unusable because of well-known and in internet forums documented hardware defects. I start experiencing problems already a couple of years ago, with the built-in camera out of order. I could still survive without it, as the warranty expired already, although I felt a laptop of this price range should have a longer longevity of the camera.Then the problem with repeated keys on the keyboard appeared. I am a programmer, so you can imagine how this is hitting on my nerves (and professional efficiency in the end) when with the time this becomes a frequent failure.The last drop came few weeks ago, when the so-called “flexgate” issue started affecting my laptop as well. Display goes off as soon as the lid is opens over a certain tilting angle (about 40°, below that angle I really challenge everyone to use it for a normal job). Obviously, I could not keep using it and I brought it to the next service point. Although the defect is identical to the one recognized as covered under the Service-Program on the 13” model, the authorized service point rejected to cover all 3 defects, presenting a huge estimate for the repair.The first frustration came, as the Apple phone support suggested me to go to the next service point on the wrong opening times. I had to drive there twice during the same day.Secondly, they did not speak about costs which might have been incurred even in case the parts were not replaced. As I said, I was in a different country and apart from the language barrier, I was assuming, diagnosing a fault was not charged to the customer, as it happens in the country where I bought the item. Instead, 2 weeks after the service point presented me an invoice through email, no repair done, no goodwill exceptions approved. Not even a phone call is an Apple customer worth.The service point was hiding behind the fact that they had to check with Apple, if the defects were to be covered or not under any service program and could not know in advance about the decision.Now, obviously I was not happy with that outcome and called the Apple support again. The personnel are not showing any empathy to the customer, regardless whether I bought merely an iPhone plastic cover or if I had been a loyal customer of expensive hardware during several years in the past. They keep repeating that if any goodwill exception, this must be coming from the local service-point, which as you can imagine, in turn bounces back the responsibility onto the manufacturer.At the same time, Apple does not do anything to push the service point in doing so. What a disaster of a worldwide enterprise who should really take seriously the advice or changing things for the better!The impression is really, that Apple claims to operate on the field through a well-established network of authorized resellers and service points, but in fact they are totally disconnected and not working together, at least when it comes to meet the customer’s needs.I have been working in a customer support role for a high-end product for 15 years and the first thing you learn, is that customer is king, especially, when he has invested a consistent amount of money into the brand and when an evident failure is not caused by customer abuse but rather linked to a product demonstrated weakness. Apparently Apple is not yet realizing that basic rule or is showing arrogance enough vs. customer retention and advocacy based on the high profit they are earning through pure marketing investments.Date of experience:June 01, 2021",4,M.M.,1,Germany,2021-06-01 00:00:00.000000,many electronic warranty expensive last awful human coming native worst former happy pro wrong nice thirsty bad old unusable hardware couple felt programmer imagine frequent last lid certain normal next defect identical authorized huge first next wrong opening drive different covered happy empathy plastic expensive several past local push authorized first consistent evident basic enough high pure,Positive

"Worst customer service I have ever experienced.I have been a loyal Apple customer since 2005, having purchased two iMacs, a Mac mini, an iPod, two Apple TVs, half a dozen iPhones, 8 iPads, and thousands of dollars in apps, music, and tv shows from the App Store and iTunes Store.Last week I purchased multiple complete sets of classic Warner Bros cartoons.  I also purchased 15 individual cartoons from the Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection.  The entire collection sells for $39.99, or you can purchase them individually for $2.99 each.  Many of these cartoons were repeats of ones that I had already purchased from previous sets, which is why I didn’t buy the complete set of this item to begin with.  Each time I bought an individual cartoon the price to complete the entire set went down by the amount I paid for the individual cartoon, in this case $2.99.  So after buying the first individual cartoon I could complete the set by paying $37, and after the second cartoon by paying $34.01 etc.   I ended up purchasing 15 individual cartoons for a total of $44.85, which is more than the cost of buying the whole set.  At that point I assumed the cost to complete the set would be 0, since I had paid more than the original $39.99 price for the entire set.  To my surprise that wasn’t the case.  The price to complete the set reverted back to $39.99.  I contacted Apple multiple times regarding this, twice by chat and twice by phone.  I explained to them what happened.  They have a record to verify what I told them.  I respectfully asked if the could complete my set since I had paid more than the asking price, or if they couldn’t do that then could they please refund the money I paid for the individual cartoons and then I would purchase the entire set for $39.99.  Both of my requests were refused.  I even had two supervisors get involved, the last one by the name of Janina.  It didn’t help.This is not a lot of money.  That isn’t the point.  What is disappointing is that I no longer feel I can trust Apple.  To treat a long-standing previously loyal customer in this way, by refusing a simple reasonable request, tells me everything I need to know about this company and it’s culture.  It’s sad really, because when I first started buying Apple products I raved to my friends about how great their customer service was.  At that time it was the gold standard in my opinion.  Those days are over.  This is the worst customer service I’ve experienced from any company.Date of experience:May 25, 2021",174,John Healey,1,United States,2021-05-25 00:00:00.000000,multiple complete classic individual anniversary entire many previous complete begin individual complete entire amount individual individual second individual total whole complete original entire entire last disappointing loyal simple reasonable first great gold standard,Positive
"We have had Apple products for yearsWe have had Apple products for years, we still have the 1st computers that came out. Never had problems with Apple Till now they don't stand by there products or customers. Once the warrenty is up. They drop you like a nail. We had a phone for 4 months and it had a 90 day warranty, 2 weeks after warranty surprisingly the phone gets a defect on there end they blame the carrier AT &T, but did not try to fix or resolve the problem except dignostic test which the phone is good, but no one knew what they were doing to fix the problem except say we need to get a new phone ??? Since its out of warranty it will be 400.00. We have not even pd the phone off yet. They do not help customers after the warranty is up its just no ifs and or buts only thing you can do is buy a new phone. Horrible service will never buy an Apple product ever again.

"Apple steals from users.They do make great, though way over-priced products, but, like most companies, they have a dark side.After losing $75 when my iTunes balance disappeared into thin air and the only way to get it back was to find the gift cards which I redeemed, (which I couldn't find) I started to do some research.Since 2008, thousands and thousands of Apple users have had their iTunes or App Store balances just vanish.It's 2021, and Apple has not done anything about it.It's understandable, though, because they make $millions in pure profit from those balances.The most common scenario is after an iOs update, the user's balance just goes to zero. It's been happening for 13 years and Apple knows about it.The only way to get your money back is to prove to Apple that your balance wasn't $0.00 before the iOs update. This requires hours waiting on hold, escalating to senior CSR's and having the proof, for instance- the physical gift cards you redemmed. A process that can take hours or days.Some users that have the time and energy to bear that process are able to get their balance restored, but what about everyone else?Apple simply absorbs the profit.Even worse, if you mention disappearing account balances on the Apple forums, your questions get deleted and you get blocked from posting entirely.I'll be migrating back to Android as my phones and tablets get replaced.Date of experience:May 21, 2021",1,msbav8r,1,United States,2021-05-21 00:00:00.000000,great dark thin understandable make pure common update hold senior proof physical able android,Positive

"Apple are a load of codswallopI used to be a die hard Apple customer, all that has gone completely out of the window after the experience I have endured over the last couple of weeks. My Dad died earlier this year and he left behind an iPhone 11, to which my mother gave to me. I tried to get Apple to help me deactivate the phone  and clear it for a new user because it was disabled and such a simple thing turned out to be a long journey up a Garden part. I was subjected to being on the phone for hours, downloading various things and having apple staff connecting remotely trying to resolve the issue. I was then advised to get the IMEI number and proof of purchase from the store where the phone was bought. I travelled to the store, they couldn’t give me proof of purchase in store and advised I request a copy from head office. I did all of this uploaded all the documentation and received an email saying the info was insufficient. I spoke to a million different people at Apple until I demanded to be passed to a senior staff member. This senior manager then told me to get the serial number from the box, I explained my dad is dead and he bought the phone last year there is no box. I called o2 back and the lady who was assisting said  in her 9 years of working for o2 bereavement she has never been asked for a serial a number only the IMEI and other basics. To wrap this whole long saga up after numerous calls and speaking to the incompetent staff at apple I was finally put through to the BS  ‘Legacy team’ who then said I need to apply for probate blah blah blah. It is so frustrating that my dad who died suddenly paid all that money for a phone my mum gave it to me and now I can’t use it because Apple want your blood and DNA. I will never ever buy another Apple phone as long as I live and take this from someone who has had Apple phones for years. BS greedy company with no compassion and consideration, they pretend to put customers at the core of their service but they are nothing more than greedy leeches  who are over saturating the market with their greed. I believe it will only be a matter of time before IPhone will go downhill. Karma is real and I promise I  try s only a matter of time.

Fault was rectified and service was good but the fault is now happening again. Seems to be a known concern on this particular model.I contacted Apple via the live chat to see what kind of guarantee came with the repair. It took over 2 hours and three different advisors to get a straight answer. One advisor in particular was very rude and condescending and kept supplying me with false information, claiming that Apple doesn’t offer any warranty or guarantee at all. She also claimed that my battery wasn’t faulty, despite not having seen the concern.The phone I bought from Apple is crap, and so is the aftermarket support and customer service.The volume of negative reviews on this site highlights how ineffectively Apple deal with problems.

"Apple Support unwilling to assist handicapped childHi All,I thought this would be a great place to share a very unfortunate experience with Apple Support. I really hope that others will have more luck or perhaps think twice about purchasing Apple products especially with the lack of empathy and understanding from Apple support team.I have a visually impaired daughter who has been fighting for her sight since she was born, she is now 10 years old and has used an iPad as a key tool in her everyday life since she was a baby and unfortunately can't see more than 30cm in front of her today.We purchased the first iPad for our daughter when she was only 4 months old as doctors advised us that visual inputs were key to developing her sight and stimulating parts of her brain responsible for vision. She has learnt to use an iPad as a tool in her everyday life. It is used for everything from taking photo's of her homework to zoom in on content to relaxing and watching TV or socializing with friends.Recently her iPad Pro stopped working so we decided to purchase a new iPad Pro directly from the Apple online Store. Unfortunately the delivery time on the Apple store was over 2 months. This means that our daughter doesn't have a key tool she uses in her everyday life to assist her with basic tasks like school work or zooming in on items to see them.In an attempt to assist her I contacted Apple support in the hopes that Apple might be able to help, however according to Apple in Denmark they couldn't do anything. I asked if they would be able to speed up the delivery date, or perhaps provide a temporary solution but without even taking the time to research if this was possible I got a direct answer that this was not possible and not something Apple does. I have to admit I am shocked at the response from Apple Support and how they handled the situation. A hugely profitable company was not able to support a 10 year old girl with a solution for something so life changing. Especially as I was able to show Apple a purchase confirmation you would have thought they would be able to assist but that is obviously not the case.I will let you make your own judgements but I have to say I am hugely disappointed and it is quite obvious to me that inclusion is not a priority within Apple.Date of experience:May 11, 2021",2,AH,1,Denmark,2021-05-11 00:00:00.000000,unwilling great unfortunate hope empathy daughter old key everyday front first old visual key responsible everyday photo pro new key everyday basic attempt able able temporary possible direct possible profitable able old able able let disappointed obvious,Positive

"Review of a MacI had a PC for all my life, and thought they all were okay. But as my demands for certain things grew (had grown more than I had realized) the first Mac I got completely changed my standards. I had even disliked Apple before; thinking they just sold an expensive brand/image with the ""same"" hardware. But what I love most about my Mac is the OS; My impression is that Windows computers are built around the _computer_ whereas Macs are built around the human. It is much more fluent to use, and is far more stable than all PCs I have ever had (a couple of them high-end).Also; (I have the old kind of Macbook Air still) it has a build quality I have never encountered in any PC, and (actually the number 1 thing I look for in computers) it is completely silent 95% of the time, which is worth a lot to me.So yeah, I do think some famous brands are overvalued, but Apple (at least their computers - the only product of theirs I have used) is not one of them.Date of experience:May 09, 2021",6,Carl,5,Sweden,2021-05-09 00:00:00.000000,certain grown first expensive os human much stable old silent worth famous,Positive

"Google was massively seed funded by the CIA, but Google got Apple to block my App Store review when I mentioned that and they also removed my previous edit where I didn’t write that.As the owner of two iPhones and a MacBook Pro I’m extremely disappointed with Apple and their collusion against me with fellow members of the smartphone tech duopoly, Google. Below is the review of Google Maps Apple refused to post on the App Store, after they had previously posted it for months without an addition I made. When you submit a review it is not immediately posted. I have recently learned that it goes to the developer, who has an option to reply or “report a concern”. Google had previously deleted SIX out of SEVEN related Google reviews at around the same time that were TRUTHFUL, FACTUAL, HONEST REVIEWS of appalling, abusive, corrupt treatment I had suffered over a long period of time at the hands of English solicitors, police and companies. Yet they ask you to help others by writing your honest account of your experiences with the company or at the location. Google did this to hide the shocking pattern of abuse and horrific treatment that I had suffered from these English police and firms. It deleted so many reviews without explanation, warning or notifying me or giving me a way to contact them to question, challenge or appeal its extreme and damaging actions and even when I used my Google Account feedback to write to them, they never bothered to reply. This is the Chinese Communist style censorship ability introduced by the advent of the internet and related tech firms, many of whom were seed funded by the CIA, NSA and DARPA.My first App Store review of Google Maps was a one star review but said nothing about their funding sources. Some weeks later I added the removal of my six reviews and Apple allowed that, although Google may have reported it. It was when I added that Google was seed funded by the CIA, the previous edit disappeared (which seems to happen when you edit), but my update failed to materialise. So they removed what they had previously passed, without posting my update. Why did Apple not leave the former edit in place if they didn’t want my update? I now realise that Google developers reported my update, so they removed six of my reviews on their own website, then had Apple remove my review which spoke of their deletions. Google, which is a product of the US military’s DARPA, is a very sinister company.I tried reposting and then re-edited my post to remove the CIA reference, I posted and waited a few days, then I became frustrated and I used the review writing facility to speak to both Google developers and Apple staff. I said my updated review was blocked, my OK’d review removed, that attempts to repost, even repost without the update hadn’t been accepted. I said I would make a complaint. Strangely, the next day the post I had been waiting to see posted suddenly appeared, but the next day Apple responded to my complaint by removing that which they had decided to allow, never to post it again, even edited, despite many attempts.I have been prevented from giving any review of my experience of Google Maps app at all, which as an iPhone user of the app I am supposed to have the right to do, like anyone else. And this is with no communication from Apple or Google, who are deliberately frustrating me and adding to abuse I have been suffering for long. Apple tell the app devs they won’t tell the reviewers the devs reported them, but I know Google did take advantage of my frustration and that Apple is colluding with Google against one of their own customers to do to me what notorious censors Google have already done to me many times.My review of Google Maps suppressed by Apple:“What I noticed while using the app was that when I logged out and used it, I started getting ads from a taxi operator. This tells me my personalised log-in data coupled with my location data over time is very valuable to Google, like gold. So they don’t bother with the ads when you’re logged in. But when I logged out, they felt they had to monetise me in some other way. The personal and location data compromise with Google is far too much for me to use this app long term. They really prefer you to be logged in when you use the app, but it’s not necessary. I also found they encouraged (or one could say “tricked”) me to set location to “Always On”, rather than “While Using the App” using the reason that I would receive up to the minute traffic information. But the traffic info was perfectly OK even when location was only on “While Using the App”, so I think it is highly questionable of Google to encourage us to have location always on.No way is this app as “free” as it appears.""Date of experience:May 01, 2021",87,Tony Ajayi,1,United Kingdom,2021-05-01 00:00:00.000000,previous write disappointed fellow truthful factual abusive corrupt long pattern many contact communist many first previous update former update military next next allow many right else long advantage notorious many valuable personal much long necessary questionable free,Negative

The man at the genuis bar looked at our computer and recomended that we not buy a new computer, because our version was not sold anymore and was a really great model.

Everything looked good, it was working fine. Then I took it home and within 2 weeks it stopped working. COVID happened and the store was moved so it took us like 4 months to come back. I made an appointment and came in. The genius man assured us we still had a warranty, that they will keep it and call us when they know the problem.A few days a very rude lady called me to tell me there was no point fixing the computer because there was water damage all over the battery.I swear on everything, I never EVER spilled anything on it after it was fixed.

"COMPLAINT: Most terrible phone with unsuitable support optionsCOMPLAINT: Most terrible phone with unsuitable support optionsToday I raised a number of issues culminating in 101375498511.Worth saying I have been a user and advocate for apple for 36 years since my LC at the age of 7 to today.This is the second time my iPhone XR's screen has failed.The first occurrence was a massive inconvenience, having to go into store and wait for over a week or two for a repair. On first occurrence its moderately acceptable for a consumer to manage issues. On the second occurrence this time its not acceptable for a consumer to be inconvenienced considering the original price of the product.At it is the two support options don't work for me:1. In store repair - I have a disability, I am at greater risk during this pandemic, I cannot go into store because I don't have transport, I will also not conduct travel during the pandemic. Lastly and importantly I will likely be without the phone for personal and mostly business reasons. My business is struggling in the pandemic as it is. I cannot afford to be uncontactable for realistically a week2. Mail in - Again importantly I will likely be without the phone for personal and mostly business reasons. My business is struggling in the pandemic as it is. I cannot afford to be uncontactable for realistically a week.I believe apple need to supply a solution to help people in this period. That means using the apple care plus track and supply a stop gap phone during repair.I have said that I would pay for this stop gap phone but that is not an option and there are NO other options than 1 or 2. That cannot be possible in a trillion$ market cap organisation?There must be pathways where apple TRULY support their customers and not just say so. That means not putting them at an extremely convenience for repeat faults. This screen fault has already consumed about 2 weeks the first time and now 1 day.The guys at the highest customer support tier claim there is nothing I can do, but there should be.Come on Apple we stand by you, stand by us with some method that works and offer paths to exploreThe most I was given was a feedback link with a character limit too small to explain my disappointment at apple.This is the fastest way to loose customers.Date of experience:April 27, 2021",1,Neil Batchelor,1,United Kingdom,2021-04-27 00:00:00.000000,terrible unsuitable terrible unsuitable user second massive wait first acceptable second acceptable original pandemic travel pandemic likely personal pandemic likely personal pandemic possible support convenience screen first link small disappointment loose,Negative

I called Apple everyday and even went to the supervisor multiple times and I still lost all of my newer contacts, all of my IMPORTANT FILES, my notes, apps, and messages.

"Apple engineers are incompetent and customer service non-existentApple have hindered getting a resolution to problems making and receiving calls, which get cancelled or immediately dropped for no reason on my iphone11 pro.  The screen also goes black unexpectedly as I'm using the phone.  I followed all advice online with no success before contacting them.  I contacted Apple a month before the end of the warranty period and have jumped through numerous hoops since whilst they tried to decide if the issue was ""environmental"" (i.e. network), software or hardware.  Customer service is inconsistent and difficult to access (a senior advisor was assigned several times to my case, which shouldn't happen as they're supposed to stick with a single case once referred to them).  The phone has been used in multiple places with the same problems recurring, taken to store (who found nothing wrong), had multiple factory resets, even switched SIM cards and it's unequivocally the handset that is the problem.  The problem was finally passed to Apple's engineering department who claimed there was no problem despite numerous instances of cancelled phone calls during a test period.  Faced with my screenshots of the call history during their (non-)diagnostic test they eventually ""recognised"" it as an ""emerging problem"" but no solution has been offered in over 6 weeks.  Nearly 3 months have passed and despite my regular follow ups and complaints Apple have not resolved problems with the core function of a phone.  Their ""support"" is a joke (worse than useless because of the amount of my time they've wasted) and Apple's engineering department incompetent.  1 star is too much for a company who ignores evidence and treats customers like dirt.Date of experience:April 27, 2021",1,H Poore,1,United Kingdom,2021-04-27 00:00:00.000000,pro black numerous decide environmental difficult senior several stick single multiple wrong multiple numerous call diagnostic regular useless much,Negative

"If I could give zero stars I wouldIf I could give zero stars I would. I had the worst customer service experience of my life last week at an apple store in littleton Colorado. It was the store in the aspen grove complex at Santa Fe and Mineral. With Covid regulations, you have to have an appointment to even walk in the store. Which is completely understandable. So my family and I made two appointments. I was looking to buy a new I pad or Laptop. My mom had just bought a new I phone 12. The first appointment was scheduled at 5, this one was for me to talk with a sells rep and get help to determine what product was the best for me. The second appointment was at 515. This was for my mother and my daughter. They needed help transferring the data from my moms old phone to her new one, erasing the phone, transferring the data from my daughters phone to her old one and getting her Apple Watch paired to the phone. When we walked in at 5 and told them about our appointments, they started off by telling us that we couldn't have two appointments. That every one gets one 15 min session. We tried to explain that we were there for two different things but they didn't care. After having to argue with them for 10 mins, they finally told my mother and daughter to go wait outside in the cold until their appointment. (Which was in 5 mins). I was then directed to my sells person. He asked me what I needed a new I pad or Laptop for. I explained the things I use the products for and started asking him questions about the differences between the I pad Air vs the Pro vs the different laptops. I was asking about the processors, the memory and such. The sales person told me they are all the same, when your just answering E-mail. He made me feel like a complete idiot and after asking a couple of question in less than 10 mins, He told me I would be better off just ordering something on line from home. I was ready to spend any amount of money I needed to, I was ready to get the best product with all the bells and whistles, but left empty handed and so upset Im looking online for other non-apple products. My mom and daughter were up next. They told the genius about their situation. They were told that would take more than the allowed 15 window they were given, after waiting almost 20 mins for their appointment. (BTW we noticed 6 or 7 other employees just standing around while they waited.) He then told them their question was basic stuff and they should be able to figure it out on their own at home. My mom wanted to buy a new case and screen protector. She was going to buy the apple I care for both phones. But was sent out the door, also feeling like an idiot. I know this is long, but I just can't believe the total disrespect and complete rudeness of this Apple store. If your planning on spending any money with apple or have a question or problem. You will be better off watching you tube videos and ordering on line.Date of experience:April 23, 2021",16,Jackson,1,United States,2021-04-23 00:00:00.000000,last aspen fe understandable new new first second old new old explain different wait cold new pro different complete idiot ready ready empty upset next told appointment basic able new total disrespect complete tube,Positive

"Will not honour international warrantyHorrible! Apple Norway takes the advantage of using Resellers to service their products. The resellers are not trained in handling Apple products sold outside of Norway, and they have no intention of honouring international warranty whatsoever. You must call Apple beforehand so that they can inform them before showing up. I did, and Apple Norway would not take responsibility for the obvious design flaw. The staff were just laughing at my claims, and thought it all was just funny because they aren’t obliged to repair products sold outside Norway (due to strict domestic laws; reklamasjonsrett). They quoted me $1000 to change the screen due to overheating components in the screen assembly! I described the design flaw and that I knew what caused it and they wouldn’t listen even though I knew I was right... I was redirected to the «Brand Manager» who had the title as a brand damage control specialist. He pretended to know Norwegian, but it was obvious he worked in Cork, Ireland. He was not helpful at all and wouldn’t ask my questions. Apple Norway uses their market position to behave like they have no competitors.

"New to the world of AppleI am new to the Apple world.  I recently bought an Ipad Air 4th generation.  Lovely.  I have a large number of music files on a Windows PC which I wished to transfer to my Ipad, to have them physically present on the Ipad, not in the Cloud.  With an Android tablet it is an easy task, just connect the tablet and copy the folder with the music over. Not so easy with IOS.  I called the customer support line and had difficulty making the operator understand, she did not know how to do it.  So I asked for another operator, who similarly did not understand the question, nor was able to answer my query.I finally managed to talk with someone else.  He eventually understood my request, but basically he did not know how to help me.  II had been on the phone for 45 minutes, and three operators were unable to tell me how to make hard copies of music files held on a PC, to my Ipad.I finished the call and then went on to an Apple support page, where I found the answer, which is simply to connect the Ipad to the PC and select ‘share files’ in Itunes.  It was so easy.  I copied my files to VLC and am now happy that I also have my files on my Ipad.However, I now have little confidence in Apple support, if they are unable to answer such a simple question.

"I would give less than one star if possible..I would give less than one star if it was possible. The worst customer service I have ever come across. McDonald's has better customer service. There was an unauthorized purchase on my account by my 3 year old. And because I was FOUR days late on the 60 day return window I was told by the manager Niesha that there was absolutely nothing she could do. I was unable to find any contact info in the apple store or how to stop the subscription in the store. It was for a relaxation app and one year subscription. And was never used. I reminded Niesha, the manager that we are in the middle of a worldwide pandemic and I am dealing with many issues at the same time. You would think any business would have a little compassion for those sick & mothers stuck at home working full time & babysitting full time. I have not asked for a refund the entire 10 years I have used their products. So because of the crappy service over a $25 subscription, I will be returning two iphone X, iwatch, ipods, and the ipad that I own.

"Worth the read!I helped my Nana try to apply for their credit card and that biased coding stuff is no joke. It is not only sexist but age discriminatory. This woman has perfect credit and the declined her because they couldn’t “confirm her identity”. We called customer support for an explanation on how you can’t confirm an identity when all the information they ask for was 100% accurate.( I would know I had to type it all in and retake pictures of her ID 3 TIMES before it even worked). The lady over the phone spoke nothing but obvious statements like the address we typed in has to match the one on her ID. Like no S**** Sherlock. So I told her to forget it and instead she applied for an Amazon credit card, was instantly approved and got a 2k limit. She got the same exact thing she was originally gonna by from the apple store for 200 DOLLARS CHEAPER. For the same exact thing.

Well just recently I made my dream come true and bought the new Mini Mac. Why did I wait so long? It's a pleasure to use, supper fast. I have taken to it like a duck to water. I didn't get the apple screen, they seem very expensive compared to others. I went for a 4K Samsung screen which is clear enough for my needs and less then half the cost of the Apple screen. I have loaded my photo programs for editing photographs etc. and the mini mac races through any task thrown it's way.

"I felt betrayed after being a loyal customer for so many years. Bad customer service.As an owner of 7 Apple products, I am appalled at the customer service I have received today. It has made me rethink about Apple being my go-to company for technology products. It is the case in my household that an Apple purchase is often made without a second thought – a new laptop? MacBook it is. Looking to buy a smartwatch? Apple Watch will do the job. Need headphones? AirPods are the best investment. Need computer peripherals? Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse cannot be beaten.Due to this decision-making process, I am upset today and challenging my thoughts; despite having enjoyed excellent customer support throughout the previous many years, it has left a bitter taste today. Having spent thousands of pounds on Apple products, my request today was for a value much smaller: I had forgotten to redeem the Apple Fitness+ 3 month free subscription when I bought my Apple watch. This can be put down to the COVID-19 pandemic and fitness not being a priority over the period. “It’s okay”, I thought, as the customer support will be able to help me, just as they always have. I was wrong.Having politely asked for an exception to the rule and have the offer on my account activated; I was rudely told that this is not possible. For a £30 subscription, Apple has lost a client whose value is much higher to the company. It can be seen on my account that I am a loyal customer of Apple.I’m not one to leave negative reviews for companies and try to see things from their perspective. I am also not disappointed about the loss of the £30 subscription – I’m disappointed that I had embedded trust into a company and felt like my trust was misplaced – I have been let down. I feel betrayed for investing in Apple products only to be rejected without much explanation or offers provided. In contrast, other telecommunication companies offer discounts by the least.Having portrayed my disappointment to the Apple advisor on the phone support, he dismissed my views without much thought. After telling him that I will be thinking twice before buying Apple products, he simply said “well, at least you know for the future how offer redemption works”.I’m not sure I have quite grasped that yet, but I have a very clear idea of how Apple operates as a company. As a matter of principle, I will certainly not be purchasing any more Apple products in the future.Date of experience:April 06, 2021",87,Aurora,1,United Kingdom,2021-04-06 00:00:00.000000,loyal many bad second new magic excellent previous many bitter forgotten free pandemic able exception possible much loyal negative disappointed trust much much know sure clear,Positive

"Apple batteries go fast! Expect you to pay storage! Expensive!Apple, is expensive. It’s wrong that when you purchase a new phone which the price ranges from 500 upwards. They want you to pay for more memory. This is not right and is unfair. Because people can’t afford these phones yet take out contracts and are expected to pay for more storage.I like Apple because it is much easier than Androids. I am seriously thinking about changing my phone. Since, I have had these phones there has been nothing but trouble. For example, I had the iPhone 8 and had lots of trouble as time went on. I contacted Apple customer service who tried to charge you to have a look which ranges from 250-300 pounds not forgotten if they have to repair.They manage to do mine because of a error on the product. So, had to send in for a repair. And was easy enough to send. The only problem I found was that the link to say what they were doing was not helpful.After a few days I received a phone back was not my old one but apparently not a ‘new one’ or an ‘used one’.The reason was that my phone was stuck on the Apple logo and would not be removed.I think it’s wrong as I have had androids phones and know people who have had them and they have had no trouble with regards to memory and batteries.For what the product costs Apple needs to improve the quality. Also, the storage says about on the device but there’s no way to remove it. Also, you should not have to pay for more memory when you buy a smartphone that costs a few hundred pounds. I expect it better than other phones.I contacted the apple customer service again as this new phone keeps playing up since the download and told me to reset the phone and I asked whether it would delete anything and she said no but once came back on it appeared to have deleted.Another, thing also is iCloud backup as you cannot complete it without purchasing more storage as I’ve tried many times to backup but won’t allow me.I have 11.7 GB of 64GB used and yet it still appears to say the phone storage is full on my emails and settings and when I try to do backup.I am seriously considering buying another phone because I’ve had many iPhones and they are poor quality. I think it’s wrong a company can charge so much for a phone or product that battery goes quick and they expect you to pay for more memory and get fixed at their centre so you have to pay more money.

"Poor customer service, and uninformed management.I recently took my iphone and iMac into the Apple store for long standing issues. I'll start with my iphone, while working on my phone with a store employee and getting very involved in what we were doing a store supervisor told the person who was working with me that they had to break away from me and help someone else and a new person was going to take their place and we had to almost start all over again. I ask why that took place and I was told that Apple doesn't want employees working with one person too long so they keep moving employees around. This to me is a major inconvenience to the customer, and this action demonstrates EXTREMELY  POOR customer service. We the customers deserve far better treatment than to be treaded off like an old broken piece of equipment. This practice is disturbing  and uncalled for and I would like to see this procedure changed. Remember we customers are your life's blood and your bottom line. I would love feed back...Now my iMac, like my phone I have had a issue with my Mac for over a year, that seems to be unfixable. And after taking my Mac into the store, I was told that only software engineers could fix the issue on my Mac. Again while working on my Mac a supervisor told the employee to hurry and get done and move on. The issue was not solved and I was told that they would have someone call me to arrange to ship my Mac to a repair center, finally this morning I became tired of waiting and I called to find out what was taking so long. ""BUT"" while trying to talk to a support person my new phone started acting up and no one on the other end could hear me. I took my phone to the store and once again after working on my phone for a while the supervisor pulled the employee (who was doing a great job) and moved her and put someone new in her place and I had to explain to the new person what the issue was and what was going on, now I'm getting upset, and after working on my phone leaving me to complete the setup, I was told to once again call support about my Mac. They did say someone would call me this evening. When that person called I was told I couldn't mail my Mac to the repair center it had to be the store personal, so now I'm going bace to the store tomorrow with my Mac in hand and see what happens.

"Training OpportunityHi,I want to share my experience I had this week at the City Creek Center - Apple Store located in Salt Lake City, UT.A few weeks ago I had a bad accident involving my phone resulting in major cracks on the front and back of the phone. I made a Genius Bar appointment at my local Apple store to see if there was any way of repairing the phone. The employee helping me told me that the phone could not be repaired, but that I could get some trade-in value for $50. I was surprised by this and asked the employee if he could double-check with a manager just to make sure I could get a trade-in value. He confirmed and told me I had 14 days to bring the phone back to the store to receive the trade-in value (I would have done the trade-in same-day, but I needed to do backup on my newly purchased phone).Yesterday, I returned to the same Apple store to bring my phone in. I told the employee about my previous conversation with the other employee, and he informed me that my phone would NOT qualify for trade-in. Disappointed, I asked him if he could double-check with someone. He came back and confirmed that I would not be able to get any trade-in value for my old phone.Now, $50 really isn't a big deal. I wasn't expected to get any trade-in value in the first place. But, I drove all the way to my nearest Apple store during a pandemic and even requested time off from work to accommodate my appointment with an Apple specialist. If the phone wasn't worth anything, I wouldn't have bothered coming in. This experience didn't make me feel valued as a customer and it makes me question the way Apple employees are being trained. Why would I have received two VERY different answers about my phone's trade-in value? I'm not sure. I think this is a great opportunity for Apple to better train their employees.Date of experience:March 31, 2021",1,Betsy,1,United States,2021-03-31 00:00:00.000000,want salt bad major genius local told receive previous able old big pandemic accommodate different sure great,Positive

"I dont mean to be a karen buuuuttt.....I dont mean to be a karen buuuuttt.....I get that they are trying to do the best during the pandemic but I have a few issues with people telling me what I can and cannot have or telling me 1 person per household when clearly they can see the person that your with has medical issues like a cane and clearly cant walk very well... So here is my issue, I get that shops have a guideline to follow but telling someone that they cant go in to assist their mother (who clearly has medical problems) immediately and after me telling them ""so your basically saying I can't assist someone who clearly cant walk properly...and what if she falls who is going to be the one to help her up? you guys cant touch her soooo..."" which made them look childish for stopping me in the first place.... so after them making the -acception- I was then forced to change my mask to a medical grade mask that I cannot breath in due to my own medical problems (I have asthma as well as low deep breathing due to anxiety causing thick masks to make me faint... Kinda like shoving your face into a pillow and trying to breath... I have difficulty breathing as it is) so after me stunned and looking at them for a good 5 seconds and asking them again what they had said to me ""we have to comply to store guidelines that were given to make sure everyone is wearing a medical grade mask"" still dumb founded because now I am being told that my mask that helps me breath, that I have worn even before this pandemic and my doctor telling me avoid medical grade (since the last time I wore one was when I was 5 and I ended up fainting in the doctors office because I couldn't breath -complained about them then-) so now I kind of had an issue. So in order for me to be in the APPLE STORE I have to wear a mask that a) feels like a pillow on my face b) causes me to faint & c) gets to hot in them which caused me to cough and freak quite a few people.So now being told I couldn't help my mother who cant walk and not able to wear my mask because it wasnt medical grade... OKAY so my mask is a garter mask with ear peices on it. Its a light fabric for those who run, bike or do alot of activities. I have 3 of them and never had any issues of going into stores until now. Which ticks me off. I do get that they are trying their best, but dont dictate which masks is the best. Mine covers literally the lower half of my head, light fabric and has unique weaving so my own spit cant even escape and doesnt over heat unlike the 3 layered medical grade. But what really gets me is that this shop isn't outside, it was in a mall... There was a total of 10 people waiting and the store was full... I dont take my mask off until I get back into my car. but of course, I had no choice in order to assist my crippled mother I had to risk not only my health (if anyone is a carrier) or someone elses (if I was a carrier) which is reckless to say the least and defeats the purpose of trying to keep yourselves safe. That was a poor decision forcing someone to change their masks because of APPLES guidelines for their stores. I could see if it was someone who WASN'T wearing a mask but for someone who was wearing a covering over their face and thats beyond ridiculous. So after exposing the bottom half of my face and putting on the damn mask we get in and I was already getting dizzy and trying to steady my breathing which was getting harder to breath in. The poor guy was watching me as he was doing a diagnostic on my mothers cell phone and asked if I was going to be okay... and I answered ""apple needs to change that policy of these masks. I am trying to keep myself coherent yet everything is going black"" the guy also agreed that the policy on dictating on which mask is the best and forcing people to change their masks in public does defeat the purpose of wearing a mask in the first place... after a good 10 mins I booked it out of the store and immediately switched back to my mask where I could breath properly. Its a good thing I dont own an apple product (yet) and if anyone is planning on going to the stores, if you have medical issues preventing you from wearing the medical grades you might as well wait till the pandemic is over, send it through mail or if they change the guidelines about masks. At this point its not worth your health and having to risk yourself on having to change your masks specially if you have conditions (low immune disorders, asthma...etc). Sorry for typing so much, but it really does grind my gears about being told what mask I can wear in a store. Im at least wearing a covering that is comfortable for me... If I do end up in the hospital because of this stupid move on which masks I can ONLY wear in the store and forcing me to change it right there I put the blame on APPLE not the people who are force to follow APPLE's guidelines. Putting me and possible others at risk is negligent because of what type of mask you wear when you go in the store.Date of experience:March 30, 2021",87,Tree'sa TeaTro,1,Canada,2021-03-30 00:00:00.000000,dont mean pandemic medical cant guideline medical cant childish first forced medical due medical low deep due thick good sure medical dumb mask pandemic avoid medical last wear pillow hot cant able wear medical light fabric dont light fabric unique layered medical shop mall total full reckless purpose safe poor ridiculous bottom mask dizzy steady poor diagnostic black forcing public purpose first good good medical medical pandemic send low told comfortable stupid blame follow possible wear,Positive

"Oh how the mighty have fallen....I’ve used Apple products for over 15 years now, and have always been pleased with both the hardware and the support I have received...until now.Having chosen to repair my iPad through Apple’s online service, I waited ca 10 days to receive the packaging in which to send away my device. I believe a good deal of this delay was caused by the chosen carrier (UPS) but since my contract is with Apple, and they didn’t provide any alternative options, I am holding them indirectly responsible for this delay.I am also holding them responsible for sending the wrong packaging, that for an Apple Watch, and not an iPad, which was of course not fit for purpose.Despite my attempts to shorten the process from here on out by using the device’s original packaging plus the delivery labels I had received, I was advised that I had to restart the process (presumably to reset the clock on the repair) and waited an additional 3 days for the correct packaging to arrive. I packed away my iPad, sent off via courier the same day. I was advised that my device had been received the following day, and actually received a replacement refurbished product the the day after that, ie today. It seemed things were starting to look up....that is until it became clear that the replacement device, which initially powered up, is unable to hold it’s charge. Another 30 minutes on the phone to Apple’s support centre (having wasted 10 minutes with one employee who took various details and then transferred me to another department with no intro, causing me to have to repeat the security process) and the best they can do is to offer to ‘pay for another repair/replacement on their own account’ - how generous! I’ve now completely lost faith in the whole process, and don’t see why I should have to waste even more of my time on this, time which is precious given I have a 7 day old baby at home, and a disgruntled 5 year old who has been without her iPad for approaching a month....first world problems I know, but within the context of having paid so much for this device and many others over the years, this is a truly awful level of customer service in my opinion. Furthermore, my attempts to get them to rectify this have been met with a request for me to wait till Friday until the seemingly very competent customer service representative I most recently dealt with returns to the office.....is this really the way one of the biggest customers in the world wants to treat a loyal customer? I suppose time will tell....Update: While very pleasant, the customer service representative who asked me to wait until today to ‘see what more apple could do’ was ultimately able to offer me nothing more than a phone call to waste some more of my time. Confused and contradictory messaging about whether they would seek to repair or replace my device with another device which would or would not be brand new wasn’t especially helpful, especially as it rather missed the point that I lacked confidence in this process as it already yielded delays and my receiving a non-functioning replacement. Ultimately, it seems Apple are either unwilling or unable to do any more than follow the standard repair process, irrespective of the fact that I’ve already had to go through an elongated version of this process once only to receive a faulty replacement device, and that now 23 days on from my originally requesting a repair, I am still without a functioning device or a timeframe on when I can expect to receive one. Well done Apple, truly terrible service all round.Second Update: After yet more wasted time, this time via the chat function, I am still no nearer to resolution.

"APPLE GOING NAZI ON PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONSLittle over a year ago since I got a new phone, I have been having problems with both, new phone and Mac.  I wanted to go in person to one of the stores but all of them were closed.  I spent several hours with technical support over the phone but they were unable to fix anything, they indicated the phone was defective so they offered to send me a new phone by mail which would not work for me as I would need help to activate/ transfer everything into the new one and it would still leave me with Mac issues.I decided to keep putting up with problems until stores would be opened again.  Stores reopened, but I just had to keep waiting as I’m unable to wear a mask.  After our State Governor held a round table with best experts ever and decided to lift masks requirements, I finally made an appointment with Genius Bar.Today I made it to my appointment bringing a face shield just in case, to be in compliance but to my surprise, face shield is no longer sufficient for Apple even at this juncture when requirement has finally been lifted in light of overwhelming true science based evidence that masks not only DO NOT WORK, but they’re actually HARMFUL to healthy individuals, let alone the ones with medical conditions.I was told I had to wear a mask also under the shield or just leave the store.  I explained I was wearing a shield precisely as an alternative since I can not wear a mask but the masked man was utterly insensitive and determined to make me leave.I asked them if they were aware that the Governor had finally removed the masks mandates and he stated they only abide by their corporate policy.Then I contacted corporate office and spent 53 minutes on the phone speaking with Sr Advisor only to confirm that indeed, Apple Corporate, in utterly departure from science, have obliviously resolved to DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS.I very much regret getting these items from these Nazis.

"Apple’s journey downhillThe only reason I switched to Apple products was great customer service (Apple store Huntsville, Alabama), You walk in and they would go above and beyond to answer your questions and do everything they could to help you. NOT in North Carolina. The worst customer service. I am not sure if Apple has changed its policy from top notch service to down the toilet bowl. Maybe they want to intentionally lose customers. Maybe all the smart people ran out or left Apple and they are stuck with dummies. Maybe it’s just NC. I went from hating iOS to switching completely to it because of how seamless the experience was with Huntsville store in Bridge Street.

"Worst Purchase Experience Ever!On 3/13/2021, I placed an order (W758740499), on Apple.com. During checkout I was giving two choices for the order; mail devices to home by Tuesday, or Express Pickup @ local store (Apple North Star).  The item was listed as available today, so I chose Express Pickup. A logical person would assume express pickup would mean, the item would be available to the purchaser sometime today, since the order was placed at 12pm noon. So about 3:30 I head to the mall, assuming, the device would shortly be available. I stop by the Apple store with my purchase information and was greeted kindly by manager Andy. Andy stated processing usually takes a couple of hours. I educated Andy, the order was made at noon and it was 4pm at time of discussion, which is 2 x couple of hours. Andy called some corporate number and stated he was advised the order was showing still processing, but to wait on the pickup email and ask for him once I receive it and I would not have to wait in the entrance line again. Well, it's now the end of day two and the store closed already. I called Apple.com regarding my purchase,  and the young lady who answered the call asked what she could help with and I explained I was calling to check the status of my purchase. She advised me to hold on and the next thing I heard was the automated system asking me to enter the extension of the person I was trying to reach. I hung up and had to call back and spoke with a male customer service rep the second time, who stated they were reviewing my payment information and it should be cleared up in the morning. I inquired why would they they need to review my payment information and for what concerns? He stated, sometimes there could be slight errors that are reviewed and have to be cleared. I educated that I was in the local store the day before and if any information needed to be verified, then that would have been the best time to verify any concerns. The truth is, all of this has been a load of crock. These are operational issues and apple has demonstrated that after a year of closure, no one was intelligent enough to have a reopening plan in place. They have demonstrated a failure to timely process orders and provide standard customer service; which is the bare minimum below good customer service. We knew they lost the vision of the company when Steve Jobs died, but it appears they don't even have leadership capable of reestablishing a functional operation. Instead of fixing the problem, they chose to treat consumers as if we're all ignorant fools they can side track to cover their own failures.

"I purchased a brand new iPhone in 2020I purchased a brand new iPhone in 2020.  It had a green dot in any photos taken in bright lighting since it was sent to me.  I expected much MORE from iPhone and Apple.  Upon recently noticing an issue with my screen display (my phone doesn't have a cracked screen or hasn't been severely dropped), I decided to call for warranty replacement.  Since then, my opinion as a consumer of Apple has drastically changed.  They do every thing they can to avoid replacing the phone and make you do ""trial and error"" with no regards to how time consuming it is for the consumer, or how many phone screen covers you have to replace.  Then the worst was after I went in for the first ""repair"" when I really was asking for it to be ""replaced,"" and they had me wait 1.5 hours for the repair and then said the ""phone was fixed.""  After this the phone actually has MORE issues.  Including a serious issue of me not being able to hear the person speaking during inbound calls. I now have to take all my phone calls on speaker phone.  This is AFTER having the Apple Store give it back and say ""it was fixed"" and it not being ""replaced"" as I had asked.  The entire reason I was asking for replacement was to avoid these types of time consuming headaches.  APPLE has no respect for the consumer.Today while calling to address that the phone was given back with MORE ISSUES than I brought it in with...I was hung up on by a supervisor after 30 MINUTES of TROUBLE SHOOTING because she didn't want to help me book and appointment and hung up on me when I asked her to hold for 1 minute as I own a business and a client was calling me on the business line.  She hung up an although had call back info, did not call back! So then I have to call Apple and start from the beginning.  I even explained all this to them.  I WAS HUNG UP ON AGAIN by Tia the ""supervisor,"" after doing about 40 MINUTES of phone support with her.  It seemed that she was making me go though UNECESSARY TROUBLESHOOTING when all I have been asking is simply to have my phone replaced through WARRANTY.  I  have experienced an issue with the phone that is eligible under the warranty for replacement and simply was asking for the phone to be REPLACED, not REPAIRED.  This is the THIRD time I had to call Apple support and the SECOND TIME I will be having to go back to the Apple Store in a week.  I will do my best to never buy an Apple product again after going through such unprofessional support, and having so much time wasted.

Spend hours online trying to see how to fix the freeze-try all the suggestions, nothing works2/26/21 1-800-692-7753 spend hours on the phone all day with Apple support forcing me to try all the same tricks over again to get the phone to work. NOTHING works, finally they agree to let me send it back but say they have to cancel the old order to do that. (I assume that means the financing that trade in as well) She refunds what I had paid and tried to order me a new phone only to tell me that ATT will not allow men to place another order for 24 hours and there is nothing she can do about that. I explain I have no phone that works at this point and was using a borrowed phone. I explain I cannot call for police or fire that it puts me at risk.She is very sorry there is nothing she can do it is all ATT at this point. At first they wanted to get my phone in for servicing instead of giving me a new phone, I insisted on a new phone. I was instructed to put the new SIM card from the defective phone in my old deactivated phone so I could have a phone. I did that.3/1/21-Call ATT, finally they give me a sales rep to tell me they are sorry but they can do nothing. Wait for 24 hours.March 2, 48 hours later I sill can’t place order online because ATT still has a hold on being able to order a new phone. Now Apple says ATT requires up to 72 hours to reactivate a phone after one is cancelled.March 3, 72 hours later I couldn’t order on Apple or ATT, old iPhone 100% dead now and can’t complete the verification code required by ATT sent to my messages because phone is dead. Can’t call anyone either. No chat function on Apple, found a chat function on ATTSpent over an hour being told my only option was to come into the store. I explained I cannot do that. They said I could call customer service and I explained I cannot do that because I have no other phone and my phone is dead. They do not serve us with landlines out here and my iPhone is my only communication device. They said they couldn’t help me. They said to try back tomorrow and see if someone there can help me.I can’t order a phone online unless I can verify my old number and phone through text they send but I can’t do that because my phone is dead. I can’t call to order on the phone and I can’t go into the store.March 4-8 days after receiving my new defective IphoneFedx Tracking shows old phone returned.ATT-30 minutes to tell me until Apple removes the installment plan from my account they can’t finance it.AppleAfter being forced to go support I am rerouted to SalesComes back with needing to ask more questions to tell sales. Wanting to know if this is a new phone returnFinally sales- shows the phone returned but said their process takes at least a couple of days to notify ATT-He could not do anything to speed that up but his goal was to make me happy. He was so sorry but could do NOTHING to help me.I am on my 8th day of trying to buy a new iPhone and being told it will take at least 2 days to a week more from Apple's side and who knows how much more time from ATT. Are they trying to run me away. I have been long time customer of both but this experience has been the most bizarre and  soul crushing as I have ever experienced. When you send a defective phone another one should be sent overnight and the paperwork to switch financing should take place behind the scenes. All of this time and heartache, I still don't have a phone. I am aghast.

"iPhone XS stopped working, only solution was ""Buy a new phone""I've had my iPhone XS, which I paid full price for ($1000+) for 2 years. Out of nowhere, it stopped turning on (flickering on and off at the Apple logo) and later got stuck in recovery mode with error 4013. I scheduled a phone appointment, who only scheduled an appointment at Best Buy for me. At Best Buy, they told me my only option was to replace the phone for $550. They couldn't identify the issue, only saying it *might* be a problem with the board. I scheduled another appointment at the Stanford Apple Store where I was again told my only option was to replace the iPhone XS for out-of-warranty price of $550 ($50 less than the NEW iPhone 11).I was given mixed answers every time about the possible issue (maybe a problem with the lightning port, maybe a problem with the logic board, maybe a problem with the software). I was told to ""yes, go to a 3rd party person to fix it... actually no, don't go to a 3rd party person to fix it"". I was told that I could then get it replaced for a price of $279, and then they turned around and told me ""whoops, we looked at the wrong thing, that can only be if there's a display issue, it's actually still $550, or you can buy a new phone"". My phone didn't even turn on, which is a worse issue than the display, yet I couldn't even get it replaced for that price.After wasting hours researching fixes, talking to customer service on the phone, & driving 2 hours, nothing was done to ensure this wouldn't happen again or to comp me for an issue on APPLE'S part. I was even told to ""invest"" in an iPhone 12...what kind of return on investment did I get on my iPhone XS?!Obviously this is just planned obsolescence.

"zero starsI am so angry because apple doesn't care about customers, but it's also crazy expensive. I had an issue with my iPhone XS where it would turn on, then it stayed on the Apple logo, and a few seconds later it powered off. When it happened I called apple and they took me through a process that fixed the issue, but then 3ish months later it occurred again, and the steps didn't work. Since I had apple care at this time, I was able to switch it out for a new phone. But on the new phone, the issue occurred again 2 months after the warranty was expired! They told me that it was an issue with the motherboard and that they knew it wasn't my fault but there was nothing that they could have done. They said that the motherboard could have been damaged from restoring my information from iCloud! I asked them why didn't the technician from the first phone inform me of this possible issue, and all they did was brush it off! Now they are expecting me to buy a new phone when it was not even my fault, to begin with. Now let's say I buy a new iPhone, and the problem continues, apple will never take responsibility. Never buying from apple again.Date of experience:February 22, 2021",3,Diana,1,United States,2021-02-22 00:00:00.000000,angry crazy expensive able new new possible new begin new,Negative

"Apple does not careApple does not care. iPhone XS cracks in the back, you have to buy a new one. It cannot be repaired. I went to this Apple store in Houston to have 2 cracked iPhone XS repaired. I shared the number of Apple devices and services that our family has bought, and the fact that I never owned a PC going back to the 1987. They said that did not matter at all, the price tag was to buy a fully refurbished phone. I called back customer care twice in a month. today because no answer after month and a half. They said that I should not expect an answer. Beware Apple does not care about the depth of client's relationship. They cannot be bothered to even answer. I was thinking of asking my wife for AirpodMax for our wedding anniversary gift. Definitely off the list. It is time to move on.

"Poor customer service, beautiful expensive machines, that will break easily and cost a fortune to fix.Avoid buying Apple products. Unless you are happy paying a premium price, for something that will break just as easily as everything else. Expect completely uninterested and unhelpful customer service. If I pay 4 times as much for an apple product I would expect a better quality product and better customer care.From now on I will avoid Apple. I bought a macbook pro from Apple.com in 2018. In Autumn 2020, I had a problem one morning where it wouldn't turn on. There was nothing to show anything had gone wrong. I take very good care of it. It just wouldn't turn on, or acknowledge the charger was plugged in. So I tried my housemates laptop with the same charger. Unknowingly blowing 2 laptops logic board. All apple products and Apple chargers.After hours talking to apple support about my options and visiting 2 different apple stores (which takes ages and is a total show where you are made to feel like a highly valued, yet, absolute idiot) I paid €500 for each laptop for the new logic boards. A total of €1000.It seems absurd that a top spec laptop can be so easily ruined by a power surge when any other cheaper lower spec laptop can have the ability to stop such a thing ruining the most expensive part of a laptop.On top of that I had to spend another €90 for a charger, and on top of that another €20 for the chord, that is only 1m long, so I cant even charge my laptop at the table. unless I want to spend another €30 on a longer one. At some point you just get fed up giving one of the richest greediest companies in the world more money.If you think your paying more money for a better quality product and better customer service, think again.

The update crashed and I had called the Apple Customer Service and brought it to the store to be fixed where I had purchased it back in 2018. I was told I need to go to a data recovery agent but this will cost me €700 minimum to get that one document back which I don't have. (I am a student University with fees!)

"Would you buy a new car without a battery??Would you buy a new car without a battery?Wouldn’t be much use would it!...Yet Apple have decided though that it’s share holders need some money back and they have blown billions!So they have fallen to an all new low by making perhaps the most ridiculous narrow minded decision to date!!As from NOVEMBER 2020 you won’t  get a charger or headphones when you buy it’s phones or iPads!Hahaha, WHAT!Like a piece of Art Deco,Yep that’s right, you can buy it and look at it basically BUT THATS IT!What they will give you though is a substandard product and a tiny lead that won’t even fit your old plug or any USB port anywhere as they’ve changed the terminals so you are forced to pay out again and if you do run out of charge on a bus train away from your special plug you are stuck!!So basically you have a totally useless product as you cannot use it at all without going back to apple and blowing more money on adapters and chargers which realistically nobody’s going to do and according to the adviser I spoke to they simply are not either as he said the returns of there products is at a all time high.Apples angle..... environment reasoning! Haha, come on! .How is it environmentaly friendly to produce twice the packaging and plastic that 100% is required to work the product? They are basically doing it to extort more money from what you see to be a gullible public.In a fast pace ever changing world people want speed reliability if they are spending the money and this isn’t it!Now most will feel resentful at having to purchase more adaptors to do the very basic tasks and think “ haven’t time for that messing around”Who Evers in charge of there think tanks wants sacking!

"WOULD NOT RECOMMENDI had an issue with my Mac book so I took it into the Genius Bar to be 'fixed' the genius staff took the MacBook out the back and brought it back instantly without it being a part and said there was no issues inside despite the Mac system saying there was. I was told it was a battery issue so I was given a new charger. A month or two later I took it in again and was given another new charger and no explanation as to why the Macs batter wasn't detected and wouldn't work without it being plugged in 24/7. I then took it in a third time and this member of staff took the Mac out the back and brought it back to show me the insides. The battery was leaking and had completely corroded whole board inside. (This could have been prevented if the first person I spoke to had done this to start with.I was then told it would be around £1,500 for the repair that it needed and I was best of just buying a new MacBook which is not what I wanted to do. I then requested to escalate this as it was an issue that could have been resolved if the staff had done what they needed to do the first time and actually looked into the Mac itself.I received an apology by the manager who told me I would be better off buying a new Mac than getting the repair. I wanted to take this further so the manger offered me a discount on a MacBook. This was agreed that the laptop would be £1,399.20 with a 24 month contract and a 14.9% interest rate. I agreed to this and was accepted through the Barclays partner finance app that the manager went through with me. However their systems weren't allowing anything to go through Barclays so I was sat waiting around for 2hours to be asked to come back the next day.I went back the next day and the system was down still so I had to sit about for another 2 hours. At this point the manager offered me a case for the laptop free of charge. I sat for another hour with still no progress so I requested that it be stopped as I no longer wanted the Mac due to the wait. The manager then offered me another deal in which the interest rate would be dropped.I was told that the Mac would be £1399.20 and there would be no interest. I agreed to this and agreed to wait a bit longer. The manager then came over and explained that it had finally went through however it would show as a 24 month contract but it would be around a 20 month contract instead as they would be taking care of the interest. He explained that I would be paying £67.16 a month until the £1399.20 was paid. This was what I had agreed to.With that I received my receipt which stated the price would be £1399.20 and I received my paper work from Barclays parter finance which has a total balance of £1399.20 to repay and absolutely no mention of interest.Skip forward to now. The full £1399.20 has been repaid as well as more and they are charging me interest.Spoke to Barclays and because it is an apple mistake they can't do anything about it as they didn't receive anything from apple to state interest won't be charged.With this being an in store issue it is in store who need to resolve this however due to covid restrictions the store is closed. I tried to call the store numerous times and got no answer so rang the customer service line.Spoke to a lady who explained there was nothing they can do as it was an in store issue but with me not being able to get in any form of contact with the store she agreed to escalate the case as I requested.Spoke to a second agent who advised that he can see what he can do, took all the information etc to then say that apple have no procedures in place to deal with in store issues due to the COVID restrictions so I would need to wait until 'soon' at a financial expense to me until the store reopens and I can deal with this in store. I advised that the complaints get closed within a certain time frame so I wouldn't be able to escalate this again in which he advised I have a month. If the store is not open within a month I have lost out on £250-£300+ which I should not be paying. This agent refused to accept this. I requested to go through to customer relations and was refused multiple times to then be given abuse off the agent, being spoke over and told ""you are in complete denial you can not speak to customer relations"" and then hung up on.I will be seeking legal advise, passing this onto the ombudsman and taking it to small claims court.Every time I get any apple products i always end up being miss sold, lied to and left to deal with it by myself with no help from customer service. They let me leave the store with a battery that was leaking due to water damage on the Mac and slowly corroding the inside of the Mac which could have caused an injury or anything as it was having to be plugged in to be used then I'm being told I need to pay an extra £250-£300+ due to their mistake.Date of experience:February 16, 2021",13,Danielle P,1,United Kingdom,2021-02-16 00:00:00.000000,genius brought new charger new plugged third whole new escalate first received new accepted sat next next free due wait total full due tried numerous able form escalate second due wait financial certain able open agent complete denial legal ombudsman small miss lied due need extra due,Positive
"Apple and UPSOrdered an IMAC on 01/02/21 - it is now 16/02 and no sign of the product.

Finally, today i got a customer service guy who did something - he phoned the hub (I gave him the direct number) where he was told there was a scan on 10/02 but now they cannot find the package - does this suggest stolen perhaps?So now I have to wait until Apple take up a missing package process with UPS - Apple guy has no idea how long this will take.

"Recently my iPhone froze for reason…Recently my iPhone froze for reason unknown.  I would press the start button for good long time but nothing changed.  I am not a tech savvy person so naturally I brought the phone to a professional who told me they could not do anything but for me to wait for the battery to wear itself out.  This took days.  Anyone who has been using smartphone for a longest time can testify how the device has become an integral part in someone's life, how we have become dependent on one for assistance.  So the solution was not helpful and my iPhone was one of the latest models.  Recently, my Apple TV is informing that it no longer supports YouTube and I need to purchase newer model.  My Apple TV is still in perfect condition but somehow I have to fork out AUD300 to get a new model.  This comes from a company that prides itself with updates (probably the reason why my iPhone freezed in the first place) but could not update my current Apple TV model... I think Apple no longer reflects what the late Steve Jobs envisioned for the users - to empower them and the cultivation of creativity freedom.   Nowadays, using Apple products feels like in a concentration camp - all controlled and dictated by a very draconian approach from Apple.  This company is an expert in disillusionment and aim to manipulate their users with their fancy marketing ploys.  I humbly urge people to think carefully before they purchase another Apple product.  It is akin to buying a hefty priced ticket to be locked up in a digital prison.Date of experience:February 14, 2021",1,Playful Raindrops,1,Australia,2021-02-14 00:00:00.000000,froze unknown good long integral dependent helpful need perfect new first current late expert urge akin locked digital,Positive

"She blatantly lied about sending me an email to repair faulty AirPods and closed my case insteadThe customer service woman I spoke to yesterday was rude and clearly couldn’t be bothered to deal with my daughters faulty air pod even though that’s her job. As it stands my daughter is stuck with faulty AirPods that are less than a year old and this would be the second repair. Absolute rubbish product would not buy again.She tried to fob us off from the get go telling my daughter to do a reboot and install the latest update on her phone and ring back if still an issue even though we told her this problem has been ongoing prior to the new update being available.She claimed I would receive an email with an authorisation hold on my card for replacement AirPods. I didn’t get this emailinstead I received a thanks for contacting email and a CASE CLOSED notification. What annoys me is I double checked my email addressed and asked her to confirm that she would send this email which she did. Clearly she blatantly lied which I don’t appreciate nor do I appreciate my time being wasted like that.She spoke ridiculously fast and didn’t make any sense.  It sounded like I got through to a call centre in India. I asked her to slow down and speak clearly but she continued to speak fast. Infact, it just got her back up but I genuinely couldn’t understand what she was saying. Her grasp of English was very poor because what she was saying didn’t make sense and she spoke fast to disguise that.There was something untrustworthy in the way she was speaking and the way she was trying to fob us off. We did ring on a Friday afternoon so maybe she was looking for an early finished and couldn’t be bothered. She had no qualms in blatantly lying to a customer though which is unprofessional to say the least. She shouldn’t be working in customer care. I can’t believe a big company like apple don’t vet their staff better and have better standard of customer care.There should be some sort of feedback or customer satisfaction follow up afterwards so we can report these things.Date of experience:February 06, 2021",5,Suf,1,United Kingdom,2021-02-06 00:00:00.000000,old absolute rubbish tried telling update new card appreciate call slow speak understand poor disguise untrustworthy fob unprofessional big standard,Positive

"Company Controlled by Greedy Anti-Online Privacy TerroristsI don't have a justifiable reason to like Apple anymore. Because I used to be able to register an Apple I.D. without having to use a phone number. However, the Apple company is now being controlled by American terrorists and Chinese terrorists who are anti-online privacy. Requiring me to enter my phone number to prove my identity just proves how they are anti-online privacy and they want to have their terroristic governments gather personal information about me instead of them politely minding their own damn business by not requiring me to enter a phone number and spying on my online activities. Apple doesn't have a justifiable reason to say that it cares about privacy because it's headquartered in a country that legalises gag orders. The other disappointment is that Apple's modern products have become expensively degenerated ever since Steve Jobs has passed away, which makes Apple not be able to hold a candle to its former glory anymore. Getting rid of the headphone jack lets me know that Apple doesn't care about audiophiles. What's really frustrating to me is that I've seen the quality of the customer support service from Apple drastically deteriorate because quality employees from Apple have been replaced by lazy employees who are only doing their jobs for a paycheck. I'm not surprised because more people are wanting to use Android phones, the Windows operating system, and/or the Linux operating system because they are tired of having Apple products cost an arm and a leg that don't last for more than 2 years. Because Apple's modern products have prices that have been rising to the point that only rich kids and rich adults can afford Apple products most of the time. Sorry, but I'm not going to enter my phone number and support a company that is controlled by Chinese terrorists who brainwash people with re-education camps, brainwashing censorship, and brainwashing social credit systems. Because I prefer intellectual freedom and online privacy rather than anti-intellectual enslavement and letting terrorists know what my identity is.Date of experience:February 06, 2021",1,Gena Ferde,1,Iceland,2021-02-06 00:00:00.000000,justifiable able terroristic personal justifiable disappointment modern able former rid lazy last modern rich rich social intellectual,Positive

"Stay clear of Apple these days, especially the Hermes Apple watchWell, I have been an avid Apple customer and defender from my first purchase of the very first iPod and have had every apple product thereafter, including now as a father of 3 who has iPads and iPhones for all my kids as well so it actually hurts me to be writing this now because I just have to accept what everyone has told me that it’s just not the same company we have given our brand loyalty to over time.I personally love my watches but this is the last thing that I moved to purchase because to be honest, an electronic watch and it’s lack of appreciated value over time never appealed to me but my daughter, who has also become an ‘Apple lover’ convinced me to get one. I found the beautiful middle ground of the series 6 Hermes leather single tour deployment buckle (order number: W807248574 just to show how genuine this is) and this was delivered in mid Nov. I didn’t use it because of the lockdown and only started to use it really around Christmas time and on random occasions since then. I don’t wear my watches within the house so as soon as I walk in it’s off so it looks practically brand new apart from the now problematic strap that is the main reason that it costs £1449!!!, which has started to fray, like a watch that is many years older.It was so ridiculous to see this that I thought it would be straight forward to get this rectified but after contacting Apple, they are saying that i have to contact Hermes as they “do not service Hermes products” (which they are selling as a bundled item with their watch on THEIR Apple website and Hermes is saying “well you didn’t buy it from our site so you have to deal with Apple”, I feel like a ping pong!I have just finally come off the phone with Apple who in simple terms have just told me “well, you just have to deal with it and we wish you all the best figuring out how you can get Hermes to help you as it’s their strap because it’s been over 30 days from the date of purchase?? £1449 down the drain, screw an warranty arrangements.In all honesty this thing (watch) wasn’t even worth the hype as are all products Apple are churning out these days and the competitors are doing much better right now. What they don’t realise is I had just purchased nearly £5000 worth of products upgrading the family’s’ gadgets and that stuff IS within the returns period so it IS all going back and the chain event of my contacts knowing this as well will also cost them a small drop of something. In all honesty I know it’s nothing compared to their overall revenue that’s why someone like me being disgruntled means nothing to them but if they are managing to loose someone as loyal as me plus my connections, I am sure that they are loosing a lot more out there which will make a difference over time.Date of experience:February 05, 2021",1,Michael,2,United Kingdom,2021-02-05 00:00:00.000000,clear first last electronic beautiful middle single genuine new problematic main many ridiculous rectified contact deal wish warranty honesty worth worth small overall loyal sure,Positive

"Screen fault and consumer rights actFrom the very beginning I experienced a pixelated screen, it occurred spontaneously and only lasted a second or so, I thought I was perhaps imagining the issue as it was so instantaneous and I could never capture it on a camera. After explaining this to an apple support provider within the 6 months of purchasing the product, I was advised there was little they could do without evidence of the issue. To be clear, this fault lasted a second or less on most occasions and appeared differently every time, very difficult to capture. I took it into the apple store (locally), within the first 6 months of owning the MacBook, they ran tests and kept the Mac for 2 days, they couldn’t replicate the issue and it passed all diagnostics tests.At this point I had already spoken to multiple different apple support advisors, spent hours of my time trying to negotiate a repair and travelled into a town centre during a lockdown to try and get it fixed, missing significant periods of university work time. I was told to keep the Mac and no further action was needed. A few weeks later I just so happened to get a picture of the screen fault (around 6 months into owning the Mac). After calling apple again, I was advised to upload pictures and take it into a repair shop. The repair took about 5 working days. Weirdly this time the diagnostics flagged up a fault with the screen. They replaced the screen. One week after the repair I noticed the screen flickering again, and now it has been two weeks after the repair the screen is significantly compromised. The screen becomes pixelated and unreadable. I have asked for a refund due to the enormous inconvenience of this issue and because I don’t have the time to return it again, wait a week, only to have a faulty product once again.Currently I am in my final year of veterinary medicine studies, a very stressful and demanding time, this issue haas been ongoing for 7-8 months, I am exhausted by it and very stressed, I just don’t want the product anymore. Without a laptop I have been totally incapable of completing assignments and revising for exams, this is a significant inconvenience. Alongside this, I have had to drive to and from an apple store twice, of which take one hour each way to commute to, I have had no expenses refunded to me despite this being a fault with the product from their end, paying for parking every time I visit the store (4 times now). I have spent over 20 hours on the phone to different apple support advisors, none of which have ever met me with a mutually amicable agreement. I have been told to await a call back from an advisor, only to never receive one. I have expressed my frustration, anxiety and stress over this faulty product and the detrimental impact it has had on my studies, which has been completely ignored by the apple team.I have explained that I no longer want this Apple Mac product, I quoted the consumer rights act 2015 and the final right to reject, all of which were ignored by the apple team as they refused to refund/replace. I have undergone one replacement which was unsuccessful and lengthy, therefore my claim falls under the final right to reject. Apple have stated the repair was done under the warranty, however I did not consent to this. I wanted the repair and the following case to be dealt with under the consumer rights act 2015, which would therefore give me the right to a refund/replacement. The reason apple have used the warranty instead is to void my right to a replacement or refund. Apple have told me that my only option now is to wait another week, drive another 2 hours, drop the MacBook off at the same service provider that didn’t initially fix it, be without a MacBook (or any laptop) for another week (despite having exams next week and moving location every 3 weeks because I am on my final year rotations), only to commute again, pay for parking again, to retrieve a product I no longer want and be a significant loss (time, money and effort), with apple suffering absolutely no detriment.Under the Consumer rights Act 2015, final right to reject, I demand this product be either fully refunded or replaced and my expenses be paid for.I have looked under the information sent to me, at no point is it explicit that I have been given a 2 week period to reject the item once purchased, which can be applied to any product providing it is not bespoke. Therefore if apple choose to ignore all other consumer rights, I want to apply for a full refund via this law- something I was never made aware of initially.It should be essential that when spending a significant amount of money on a product, if it does not conform to a satisfactory quality, it should be repaired/replaced or refunded. I have already attempted the repair option, it was unsuccessful.

"Straight to the pointHonestly, I truly hate Apple. I dislike the fact that if you have an “out-dated” phone for some reason your phone will start to glitch, freeze, and all type of other problems caused by Apple in order to force their users to update and upgrade to their latest products. No I’m mot referring to the cracked screen phones, the water damaged phones, or phones that have OBVIOUSLY been damaged, I’m referring to the phones that are outdated, not damaged, and great condition. My IPhone 7plus has been working perfectly fine for a while now, then after I upgrade the audio stops working for certain apps (GarageBand & Tagged) yet will play sound for when I text and listen to musiq. AND I can’t even FaceTime call anymore, every time I call it connects and then “fails” right when it’s about to connect (TRASHHH)!! The storage is weak, camera quality gets blurry over time, expensive asf, and fragile asf.... the ONLY pros about Apple is the “Apple Care” and FaceTime app.... this is THE last Apple phone I will ever be getting in my life. I’m tired of Apple conning the buyers, I’m going straight to a Google Pixel because it doesn’t cost the same as rent, storage is better, quality... yet then again, it’s Google and that itself is better.

"IPhone 12 Pro hereIPhone 12 Pro here . I live in an area where there are 3 towers about 5 miles away . I call it the Bermuda Triangle. And after talking with Apple support which didn’t help as they went through everything I had already done as proceed to put it off on Verizon so then Verizon put it back on Apple. From what I am understanding it’s is the problem with the iPhones handing off the signal between towers and where I live that is the perfect storm. Lots of other iPhones work fine here . iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iphone 11 , anyway the iPhone 12 Pro will not receive a call and if it barely does you can’t hear anything and you will lose the call . It’s horrible and basically a phone that can’t be used and no word what so ever about when or even if Apple knows how to fix the iPhone 12 Pro. And yes I have tried resetting network settings, airplane mode , hard resets , you name it and it won’t fix it .

"Terrible customer serviceCalled Apple today about my recent order for the new Apple iPhone 12 Pro due to a payment refused by bank for suspected fraud. I spoke with a lady representative in apple customer service who was very kind and friendly, she tried to take the payment again whilst I was on the call and again it was refused  and she advised that I should call my bank to arrange for the payment of £999 to be authorized. I spent the next 22 minutes on the phone to sort out the problem with the bank and was advised to call Apple back to arrange for the payment to be retried to see if there where any further problems.  When I called Apple to ask them to try the payment again I spoke with a male representative. He advised that the problem would now be fixed and the system would automatically retake the payment at 3pm the same day. When I tried to explain to him the situation he continued to talk over me and tell me the problem would now be fixed. I ask the representative to listen to what I was try to explain and he cut off the call.This is not the type of customer experience I would expect from a company such as Apple and for such a large purchase of close to £1000 or for any amount to be honest.I swiftly cancelled the order online and will take my business else where.Utterly terrible customer service.Date of experience:January 29, 2021",3,Lewis Downing,1,United Kingdom,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000000,terrible recent new due lady representative friendly take call spent next arrange try male explain representative cut type large amount terrible,Negative

"Phone not delivered, Apple refused refund BEWAREWe ordered an iPhone 12 Pro from the Applestore and when it was delivered the box was missing the actual device. We raised this with Apple and they refused to offer as a refund. This is even after we presented them with proof that the phone was NEVER in the box as the shipping label from DPD documented the weight as 0.3KG, which is the weight of the empty packaging.After Apple investigated this, and initially we were told that we will receive a refund, they decided not to give the refund with no explanation whatsoever. I had spent in excess of 12 hours on the phone with their horrible customer service agents and got nowhere.DO NOT BUY from Apple Store, if you want anything from Apple then go to Amazon or Currys or any other retailer.Also, they are registered in Ireland so good luck chasing them via legal methods.

"Apple TV and the elderlyMy elderly mom is an existing Apple TV user and been paying for AppleTV monthly.  She recently purchased a MacBook Pro in January 2021 and is eligible for a free year of AppleTV with Apples  urgent promotion.  When she clicked on the email link, it did not activate the free year and continues to be charged monthly.We tried calling Apple directly regarding the Apple TV promotion, but was disconnected several times via phone and had to call back and wait on hold numerous times.  I was transferred from one service department to another and then disconnected.  I was finally put in touch with a supervisor, Travis, at Apple.Travis verified that my mom is eligible to receive 12 mos of Apple TV with her recent Apple purchase.  However, he said it had been activated on Weds 1/20 and then canceled on 1/23.  He said since it had already been activated, he was not able to reactivate.  He offered to do 3 months free of AppleTV, and said that’s the best he could do.  Since I had been working on this issue for over 3 hours, I just took the 3 months of AppleTV for my mom.  I asked to speak with his supervisor to get the remaining 9 months owed to mom, and he said he couldn’t transfer me to anyone as there was nothing further that could be done.

"Wow AppleWow Apple, I am impressed.I rarely take anything back or return items. My airpod pros were malfunctioning, the left one was vibrating making a weird sound. I went to the apple store, they were unable to help me and told me to call their customer service number. I explained to the man on the phone, very kindly that they were out of warranty and how much they would cost to fix. Without really having to push it, he gave me a free replacement left air pod! It just arrived a few moments ago and the delivery took only a couple of days. I can't believe how good Apple was to me. They should know I've given thousands and thousands of dollars to the company over the years and with this generous act I will continue to do so.

"Mixed Experience with AppleI like Apple products when they work. I've had multiple products from apple: MacBook Pro, iPhones, iPad. From my experience, their laptops are really good quality but their smaller devices aren't that great. My first purchase ever from apple was an iPad 3rd generation (about 10 years ago) and let me tell you, it was so glitchy and it kept crashing. After multiple visits to the Apple Store, they replaced it for me for free; which made me happy because there was something wrong with it. With the iPhone 5, it was really good except the battery would drain almost completely after a few hours. With the iPhone 5, they would not cover it under the Manufacture's Warranty and said that the battery was fine when it clearly wasn't. Fast forward many years later, iPhone Xr is very good, fast, battery lasts for days.Point is, my experience with Apple is good when the product is good. When the product doesn't work, I am really upset. It's good when they try to resolve the issue. I do recommend the MacBooks though. My MacBook is almost 10 years old and it's still running really well. In case anyone's wondering, I never buy AppleCare, I just buy a really good case for the product so that the screen doesn't shatter if I drop it.Customer service at Apple is hit and miss. I know Apple likes to empower the customers by teaching them to troubleshoot instead of troubleshooting it themselves; I have mixed feelings about that because it can come off a bit lazy from the customer's perspective and it's not good for customers that aren't technologically savvy.I do think Apple is overpriced. I only purchased a new iPhone after using the previous one for many many years and there's too much glitches/issues with the product at that point.Date of experience:January 20, 2021",3,Mei Li,3,Canada,2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000,mixed multiple pro good great first multiple free happy wrong good many good fast good good upset good old good mixed come lazy good new previous many many much,Positive

"Support run-around until you eventually give upJust like everyone else on this page, I too have purchased a rubbish piece of junk from Apple that they refused to stand by.In the 6 months of owning my mac it had the screen\ and the keyboard replaced.When the screen failed AGAIN, they agreed to replace my computer.Their options were;1. Pay full price for a new one and they will refund me the difference once my broken mac is inspected (ie several week later)2. Send the Mac back for inspection and if they are happy, they will send me a replacement.Rather than be a further $2000 out of pocket, I chose the later.Apple arranged for a courier to pick up the broken computer.Not only did they not arrive, but the tracking number that apple supplied also showed there was no active job linked to it.After around 20 calls to support (i am serious) i was passed on to my 4th ""senior advisor"" who basically wanted to start the process again.I have a life to lead outside of talking to Apple and waiting for their non-existent couriers to arrive ""sometime between 9am and 5pm"" so I have decided to abandon the case.I wonder how many other customers Apple simply wear down through their appaling ""customer service""?Thankfully in my case its a cheap laptop - it wont break me, but i would never buy a big ticket item from Apple as you might be thousands out of pocket with zero support.And all of the above happened within my warranty period.you couldnt make this up.Date of experience:January 19, 2021",13,Tony Featherstone,1,Australia,2021-01-19 00:00:00.000000,rubbish full new mac ie several happy arrive active serious senior arrive abandon many wear cheap big warranty,Positive

After only a couple of days apple had deleted MANY important files that I stored on iOS without letting me know..For a very long time I was expecting this outcome since through the years files were just missing all of a sudden???

"Product returned but no refund.I purchased an IPhone 12 as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He wanted a different color model, so we returned the phone on the 29th of December in order to exchange for a different phone. A week goes by and I have not received my refund. Long story short I made numerous calls between Apple and FedEx in hopes to track my package. Initially I had lost my receipt with the tracking no. but luckily I found it because I had sent the original return label via email to be printed. It is now January 11, 2021 and I called Apple with the tracking no. and SURE ENOUGH the product was returned on December 31st! Apparently Apple scanned the product back but decided to keep and not return my refund. It’s been over 3 weeks now and still no refund nor phone. Customer service was/is terrible! Not one ounce of acknowledgment, apology or taking accountability whatsoever with the 6+ reps I spoke to. The s*** they put me through of trying to find the tracking no. and possibly losing the product and losing over $1,000!!! May as well speak to automated machine with minimum service.One, If Apple had done their jobs in the first place, I wouldn’t have gone through hell to find the tracking no. and should’ve received the refund after being scanned in. And two, if I did not get a hold of the original return label, the package would’ve been “lost” with Apple receiving the phone, keeping my money of over $1,000 and screwing me over! I wonder how many times Apple have screwed customers over. This “mistake” should’ve never happened in the first place.

Luckily my call gone through today in the evening about 3ish, spoke to the lady and explained everything, she said you will have to pay the deposit and we will then send you replacement cables and you will need to send the old cables back. I was really annoyed to pay again as I already paid on the original date of purchase it was £14 per cable and I bought 3, also paid vat. Then I was told you can wait till all the stores are open and you can take ur cables to the store, which is unpredictable because of COVID situation, I was really frustrated and told the women that why do I have to pay? It’s not my fault that the cable didn’t even lasted one year? She said I understand but that’s how it works you will have to pay, I heard £13, but when the send me the link to pay it was £38 and I was really angry, rang them straightaway to cancel the repair order. I was told by Derek that it’s already been despatched and there’s nothing he can do. He started giving me lectures. I said I am not happy and I only want to send one cable, first he said he will cancel the whole order, he put me on hold for about good 15-20 minutes then he came back and said sorry I can’t do anything , I said i only want to send one cable as I am not happy to pay that much amount, he said just send you working cable or any cable, but you still have to pay, and we will refund the amount once we have received the old cables back. I am very disappointed , the customer services are poor and very unhelpful. If Derek wanted he could have cancelled the whole order but he didn’t bother himself.

"I am deeply troubled by Apple’s…I am deeply troubled by Apple’s response to Parler. Anyone could understand taking a stand against violence; however Facebook and Twitter, to this day, continue to allow violent threats against conservatives and Republicans, and allowing them continue gives the appearance of political bias shows it has nothing to do with ethics.I used to resist getting an iPhone but eventually got one on recommendation. I grew to like the feeling of security and got the iPad and a Mac, but when I see police state tactics, silencing a group of people strictly based on their political beliefs, I no longer feel secure; in fact, I feel targeted.Why is this important to all? My family fled Europe before the rise of fascism. The first primary tactics of fascist is to use the circumventing of communication of the opposition and allow derogatory propaganda to persist. It is ironic that a company which makes itself successful providing superior communication would actually advocate to suppress it.If Apple had intended to take a stand against violent rhetoric, they would not have targeted one source dominated by one political affiliation. This means Apple has decided to advocate the promotion of propaganda and is no longer a company for all users.I find this action not only threatening but hypocritical of a man (Tim Cook) who no doubt faced discrimination of his own. Even in modern days, I face discrimination for my religious beliefs because it seems to be acceptable to judge my people based on stereotypes rather than merit. And now we add politics.So when you turn on the TV or listen to democrat politicians advocate for or dismiss violence against their opposing political parties, Apple refusing to take a stand against it takes away credibility. When technology changes fast, credibility can be the deciding factor in the longevity of any tech company.Also, it is important to point out that Apple refused to work with law enforcement following the Christmas terror attack on Dec 2015. Apple insisted they show that they protect their customers. I hated that they didn’t help but it made me feel that they would protect my freedom of privacy. So how does it appear now that Apple is willing to protect the rights of a  terrorist’s after murdering 14 people but won’t protect the rights of fellow Americans because their politics are different? The very civil rights we had to fight to get, you decided was no longer valid.Rather than working with the creators or Parler, you chose to cancel them. Republicans are not the only ones who should be afraid of this. Government stance on anything always changes but people have opinions and opinions change. No group is collective in thought; if they were we would all like the same foods and the same weather, would drive the same cars, follow the same religion, same preferences, etc. Eventually every person grows and changes no matter what type of politics you agree with. Once someone deviates from that thought, everything changes.Apple never took a stand when the news media and the politicians did nothing to curtail the violent organization from burning down buildings, murdering policemen, violently attacking conservatives, threatening to rape their wives, developing autonomous zones, verbally abusing Republican politicians, firing employees who are not democrats, and so much more.I would prefer Apple take a real stand against tyranny and support all platforms or be fair and remove platforms on both sides of the political spectrum for exactly the same reasons to prevent the perceived bias and to show they really do stand against violence but this may be too much to ask coming from upset customer/investor.Remember that in order to understand, you must have dialogue. The lack of dialogue is exactly why there is so much political turmoil these days and the prohibition of conservative voices will make it worse. This will cause unrest not seen in this country since the civil war. The Nazi uprise happened because of intolerance. You only have to listen to the incoming political party to hear the similarities. Even if you are angry and agree a little with them, you have to see it will take us on a very dark path.I doubt if my leaving the Apple family will go noticed but while I search for a new phone with a different company and get rid of the many Apple devices I have, I ask that you reconsider your stance on Parler and work with the creators to come up with a solution which will be acceptable for everyone. I also ask that any solution you come up with will be strictly enforced to their competitors as well. Be the leader of free communication and at the same time condemn calls to violence. Be the leader and set the example that all can follow; not just the ones that agree with you.Date of experience:January 10, 2021",1,Customer,1,United States,2021-01-10 00:00:00.000000,allow political mac police political secure important primary fascist successful superior violent political advocate hypocritical modern religious acceptable merit listen democrat dismiss political fast important willing protect terrorist fellow different civil chose afraid collective follow autonomous republican real tyranny political prevent stand upset political conservative civil uprise incoming political angry agree little dark new different rid many come acceptable free condemn follow,Positive

"Oh where do I even start?Oh where do I even start?? Apple is a evil and capitalistic company. Apple only has many customers because THEY LIE AND MANIPULATE CUSTOMERS. For example, they say the iphone 12 has a new design. Look at all the phones they released in the last 3 years. The design hasn't changed since the iphone 10. Compare Apple to Samsung and you'll see who is innovative. Apple either is taking advantage of the brainwashed public and/or they don't know the definition of innovation. They say customer service with them is 99 percent and Android is 5 percent. That's bulls*it. Apple has such a stronghold against the public and so they can say whatever they want and people will listen, EVEN if there is hard evidence proving they are wrong. Android is far better and easier to use and I'm speaking from experience. I used to own Apple products for years and after switching to android, I can't go back. Android is easier to use and it's much simpler. Oh and when people say android gets viruses is bullsh""t. What about PCs? You have to be smart how you use it and not go to sites you don't know. Itunes is downright garbage and is very complicated. I saw a CBC news video of them scamming a customer. Apple rigs and locks down your phone so you can't repair it. If you repair it, it will disable the phone and tell you to go to the apple store. Samsung on the other hand doesn't do that. Apple charges you for icloud whereas android has expandable storage. To put in in a sentence, iphones are for noobs who don't know how technology works and android is like a pc and is for people who like tech.Apple as a company takes advantage of you. The iphone XR uses a display of 720p but they say it's the biggest display ever, wth. Apple is a controlling and manipulative company. They don't care about you, only your money. They don't allow anyone except them to repair their products and they claim it's because it's done by professions. That's BS. Samsung doesn't do that. There is many videos on youtube that proves they try to take money from you. Louis rossman showed that they clearly lied and claimed it was water damage even though they just needed to bend a pen back. APPLE CAUSED THAT AND THEN SAYS IT IS THE CUSTOMERS FAULT!!!! Android just offers a much better deal and treats their customers right. Apple claims that your phone is screwed and you must buy a new phone for $300-$500 where as a 3rd party company see how it's built and it is reparable but Apple says it isn't. Apple wants you to buy a new phone instead of getting your current one fixed. I hope people will realize Apple is screwing customers over and doesn't admit it. I'm never going back to Apple.Apple has so much money which makes them think they can get away with the very wrong acts they do to customers. They will continue to do it until the public says to apple I'm leaving until you do things right. Apple is screwing you and everyone else. I have been with Samsung since last year and it's sooooo much better and I love my s10. Apple has nothing on Samsung. Samsung's displays are amazing.Date of experience:December 31, 2020",16,Morello Vlogs,1,United States,2020-12-31 00:00:00.000000,evil capitalistic many lie manipulate new last innovative advantage public android stronghold public hard wrong use much oh android know saw disable android manipulative many new reparable new current much wrong public right last,Positive

"Apple need to review their repair…Apple need to review their repair processes.The problem is not with the people but with the system. We have purchased a high spec MacBook Pro which unfortunately we have experienced multiple problems with within the first 6 months. (we also have a 7 year old MacBook Pro which we have had no problems with).Upon calling Apple our options were to return the machine and wait for up to two weeks to find out if it is repairable or to be replaced.Genius bookings are not available (which granted is not apples fault due to COVID)For us being without the machine is not an option which we of course explained to the help centre.With the prices apple charge and the whole foundation of the brand being built on the user experience there's a few options you would have hoped were suggested:- An express repair service - repaired or replaced within a few days (when you pay over £2k for a laptop I don't think this is a big ask)- A courtesy machine (again I don't think a huge ask for apple to offer a courtesy machine as an option if people are going to be without their machine for up to two weeks through no fault of their own)- A replacement machine (as we have had to have 4 calls with you now for the machine that is less than 6 months old we're happy to replace it)These are just three options that could have been suggested... but none were offered. Even when we enquired about each we were told 'it's just not what we do'.We outlined that we were being told our only option was to continue to work off the faulty laptop and wait until shops were re-opened as we cannot be without the machine to which the response was 'when you put it like that, yes'This is a simple process that Apple needs to review... a little bit of effort goes a long way. Even the express turnaround option (which isn't the best) is still something that would have made us feel a little more valued and less likely to write a bad review.I'd like to stipulate that the customer service personnel were very professional and friendly, they just either have poor training on what options are available OR Apple just have terrible options available (I have a feeling it's the latter)I'm not writing this to give Apple a bad name, we're Apple product fans through and through. I'm writing in the hope that Apple read this and adapt to it.

I noticed the camera flashed on and off and the phone no longer could hear sound unless headphones on.I made an appointment Apple Store Southampton Uk.At the store I was seen by Wayne. He said my phone despite being advertised able to cope with a rain shower had set off a sensor showing water had damaged the phone. He said not covered under warranty. In order to fix would cost me £269 plus VAT. I said but phone sold as can cope with such situations. He indicated I could be lying. I said but the phone is mis sold and how do you get the rating then. He said different conditions as in a laboratory. I asked for a more senior person and then George arrived. He said if paid the money would replace. I said but I am the customer and your product is faulty why should I pay? He said nothing they could do as policy . I asked who the senior manager was and he said there are quite a few he would not give surnames as said not policy. The store was closing and lights going off. They were tuting and clearly annoyed still trying to resolve. I explained my mother is terminally ill and I can’t use my phone a phone that does not do as advertised. The security men were all around and felt very intimidated. One said I hope you have a very happy Christmas and gave a horrid look and another laughed out loud.. Clearly all annoyed and all men just clearly wanting to get me out of the store... The product does not do what they say and a genuine issue and problem. I don’t think ever felt so upset, belittled and disappointed at a very difficult time.

"NEVER EVER TRADE YOUR PHONE IN WITH APPLE, THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!I have never received such bad service in my life, never ever trade in your phone with Apple. I brought an IPhone 12 pro in gold and traded my IPhone 11 Pro in for it and they received it back and was to give me the max of £500.00 given it’s condition I should hope so. I received various emails explaining my trade in amount of £500.00 will be in my amount in 3-5 business days on the 3rd November 2020 it was only by chance I queried with Apple because the last 4 digits of my card it was being refunded too was not one of my cards, Apple took over an hour to answer, once I finally got through they took another hour to finally tell me that when you use Apple Pay it creates a unique 4 digit card number to avoid fraud - understandable! On the same phone call I queried when I will receive the money and they informed me it had already hit my bank account and that the case has been closed. Monday 9th November my bank accounts were searched by myself, by my bank, every phone call I had with Apple blamed my bank but my bank could do nothing as it was money coming in and not going out, the phone calls I made took 2 hours on every occasion. I then finally got through to someone that was talking a bit of sense last Friday (13th December 2020) and I was informed (nearly a whole month later) to be told that the £500.00 never hit my bank account like they said and that it’s going to arrive in gift card format instead which I didn’t want. I appealed as it wasn’t even discussed if I would take that instead, even so I still to this day never even received the gift card! On Monday (14th) I called again, once again took ages to get through to someone but this time they took bank details to try sending the money to my account again, at this point I thought I was getting somewhere but no I was back on the phone on Friday (18th December) chasing again and going through the same thing I did right at the beginning of November, being told the same advice, ‘someone will ring you from the payments team’, ‘you need to ring your bank’. We are now 20th December and still not received the £500.00 and I even requested to send the phone back which they can’t or won’t do. Service is awful, they all tell you different things and it’s caused me nothing but stress!! I will be back on the phone again tomorrow (Monday 21st) chasing.

That ""Priority Queue"" is showing an expected ship date between March 17th - 31st.When I told Sam G. about this, he pretty told me to suck it up and that Apple was incapable of of relabeling my headphones because they're incompetent and are no longer the innovators of tech that they were.A company that used to be at the forefront of the tech world, retail design and customer service should not employ a service person of Sam G.'s standards and I would have gotten better service from an outsourced call centre in Asia.Thank you Sam G. for being a shining beacon of everything that is wrong with Apple today.

I don’t see what the problem is because they were both shipped FedEx andnot opened or altered in any way. I am terribly concerned with your company's return policy andthe way that they are doing things. I was also charged a fee of $2.40 by Apple that has noexplanation as to what these fees were.

Iasked for an explanation as to what these charges on my credit card from Apple were andcouldn’t seem to get anyone to explain what the exact charges are for.

"Apple would not stand behind iPad warrantyIn September, 2020. I had a very disappointing experience with Apple. My wife and I bought an iPad in December 2019. In August of 2020, the iPad developed wide lines on its screen, making it virtually unusable. We had not dropped the iPad or damaged it in any way. Even though the iPad was under warranty, we were charged $249 to repair it. We contacted Apple and asked that the $249 repair charge be waived. Apple refused to do so. At the time, I felt that I had been treated unfairly by Apple, but that there was nothing else that I could do. I recently came to the conclusion that I should share my experience with others so that they could be aware of the risks they are taking when purchasing Apple products.Here, in more detail, is what happened to me. The text below is from a letter that I wrote to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, on September 5, 2020.On August 30, 2020, I noticed that there were two intersecting lines (not cracks) across the screen of my 7th generation iPad. I phoned Apple Support and described the problem to the agent who answered the phone. He told me that since I bought the iPad in December 2019, the repair would be covered by an Apple warranty. I was then told that I would receive a box from Apple via FedEx, which would be used to ship the iPad to Apple for repair. Using the box that was supplied, I shipped the iPad to Apple on September 1. The repair ID for this transaction is D463437069 and the case number is 101170295110.On September 3, I received an email from Apple saying that its technicians had found a problem with my iPad that wasn’t mentioned in my phone conversation with Apple. I phoned Apple and was told that there was a crack in the iPad’s screen. Before the iPad was sent to Apple in the supplied box, there was not a visible crack in its screen.I am requesting that Apple provide me with documentation of the crack – the location of the crack on the screen, its dimensions and any other relevant information that would show that the crack was in existence when the iPad was in my possession. Since I needed my iPad back as soon as possible, I agreed to the repair. However, $249 is a high price to pay for an Apple product that is under warranty and was without a crack in its screen when I mailed it to Apple.I have owned several Apple products and have always been impressed by the company’s integrity. In fact, Apple has stated that:1.	Apple conducts business ethically, honestly, and in full compliance with all laws and regulations. This applies to every business decision in every area of the company worldwide.2.	Apple's success is based on creating innovative, high-quality products and services and on demonstrating integrity in every business interaction. Apple's principles of business conduct define the way we do business worldwide…3.	[Apple demonstrates] honesty and high ethical standards in all business dealings.As CEO of Apple Inc., I ask that you provide me with the information that I have requested in the third paragraph of this letter. I am asking you to issue me a refund of $249 if your inquiry into this matter concludes that I was treated unfairly by Apple, Inc.Date of experience:December 02, 2020",51,Josef Sandfort,1,United States,2020-12-02 00:00:00.000000,disappointing august wide unusable warranty screen id visible relevant possible high several full innovative define high ethical provide third inquiry,Positive

"Phone basics not includedGot a brand new Apple 12 pro max for Christmas costing nearly £1200 - and was very happy with it until I opened the box!!To my shock, after turning on the phone I realised there was no charger!!!I was sure it couldn’t have passed by Apple, a world class electronics company, to include a charger with a mobile phone. But after searching a bit more inside the box and doing a search on google I learned that actually the new iPhone does indeed, really, come without a charger!!!!My options were to buy a MagSafe, a compatible power plug or use my old phone charger!!!I called Apple and raised my concerns about the compatibility of my old iPhone charger with the battery of the iPhone 12 pro max.I was told that indeed, the charging would be a slower, but that I can purchase the MagSafe or a charging cable separately!How can any company suggest for someone to use a sub-optimal charger (potentially battery damaging) or suggest for them to BUY an essential accessory like a charger (required for merely keeping a phone turned on) after they purchase the phone for £1200...???The adviser explained that the reason a charger is not included is because phones are being transferred to some new method of charging...So, instead of providing the option to charge the old way OR providing the convenience of charging the new way, Apple has decided to do neither and instead left it to the customer to worry about how they’ll charge their brand new iPhone after they purchase it for about the same price as a the new MacBook Pro 13”.I don’t know about everyone else, but I would find it inadequate for any company to sell any phone at any price without a charger, unless the phone is purchased merely for the purpose of dissembling it using the parts or somethingIt’s quite baffling how Apple can get away with selling a phone for £1200 (possibly one of the most expensive phones on the market world wide) and NOT include a charger in the box!!!My phone is currently 25% charged and I am uneasy about how I’ll charge it when it’s out of charge!

"Ipad Pros bend and failI bought my ipad pro (12.9inch, 3rd Gen Wi-Fi) in August 2019. It began continuously re-booting itself in September 2020, which I assumed was a software issue. After some unsuccessful attempts to rectify the issue, Apple support advised me to do a factory reset. This was unsuccessful, and rendered the ipad useless, as the software had been wiped, and would not reinstall.I sent the ipad to Apple for repair, which they told me would be free for a software fault, and they have now informed me the ipad has been bent (via accidental damage) and will cost £515 + VAT to repair.

It is certainly not accidental damage, as I have never mistreated it.Having researched this topic on the internet, I now see that curved/bent ipad pros are a REALLY common issue - with many shipping from the factory already bent.

"iPhone XS sucks at being water…iPhone XS sucks at being water resistant. My iPhone XS mistakenly got soaked by tap water while brushing and now the screen went black before I could turn it off. I can still hear sounds but can't see anything. I wiped it off immediately and dried it, yet my phone is water damaged (my phone is not cracked by the way). I am so pissed because on the apple website AND while I was sold the phone, I was told it could withstand being submerged in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes, yet it crashed under TAP WATER in like 10 secs???  And to check my apple warranty, it does not cover water damage loooool. A phone that focuses on water resistance as a marketing strategy does not have warranty on water damage???  It's you guys being so calculative for me. Then I check apple repair online and it's around 650 -799 dollars for water damage Loooool. That's a whole new phone. As a student that is rent, and if I go somewhere cheaper my warranty is void loool.  Got to give it to the company's business strategist. At least bait your customers with features that actually function.

"Keep away from Apple.I have decades of IT work.  I moved from PCs to Apple because of the constant GPF and malware and virus issues.  12 years ago, Apple support had a reputation that they spoke English and were good.  That's false - but they speak English.  I get enough from support to figure things out on my own but I've watched support destroy novices with wrong guidance.I've had systems completely ruined because support  didn't know what they were doing.  They have gotten so bad that I'm trashing Apple when these computers die (one will soon and if the recent Mac isn't repaired by those that destroyed it - apple support 3rd party, it's getting trashed).Let Apple die.  iPhones are horrible and expensive and computers are way overpriced.Date of experience:November 22, 2020",4,ArghApple,1,United States,2020-11-22 00:00:00.000000,constant good false enough wrong ruined gotten bad recent horrible expensive,Negative

A couple of days ago Apple authorized the withdraw of an amount corresponding to one of the 2 phones only, then, they tried mistakenly to authorize an amount much higher than the remaining due amount (declined due to insufficient funds.) I called them many times (apple customer care do not work on weekends in some countries!!) The first time I reached them, hey opened a case and promised will be taken care in one business day. The second time I called, the operator said that the accounting team replied that the system will mistakenly continue the attempt of withdrawing the wrong amount; while holding the amount of one device, the system will try to charge the full 2 devices amount throughout a week, after that the order will be cancelled!!! They can do nothing about it, and I have to wait 7 days to get a reply from a customer care supervisor. I felt that the operator was very happy to cancel the order when I proposed so; the condition for me to cancel my order was to receive an email with the transcript of our full discussion to reserve my rights.Apple were trying to show that these mistakes are easy and normal ones, there are similar cases, they are not prompt to solve similar cases quickly, and they are ready to get rid of a problem by getting rid of the customer.Date of experience:November 22, 2020",2,Ali Chiri,1,United Arab Emirates,2020-11-22 00:00:00.000000,ordered pro withdraw due due insufficient many hey second attempt wrong full happy full easy normal similar similar ready rid rid,Positive
"3 - 5 Days For Replacement Phone + Deleted My Data w/o PermissionThe screen for my i-Phone SE 2nd generation that was still on warranty went black. It would not register touches from my finger nor did it light up. However, I was able to login using touch ID and even take a picture with the side button and home button held down, so it was obvious that the screen was defective. This was from no physical damage - no dropping, no water damage, no damage from an electrical circuit etc. One second it was working fine, then the next, it went black.The earliest they were able to get a new phone to me was 3 - 5 days. However, I run my business from my i-Phone and needed a replacement immediately. During the replacement process, an Apple senior support specialist named Ben from Apple Support Ticket ID 101245636285 told me to erase my phone on the find my iphone website. At no point did he tell me that this was going to erase my phone's data. This raised a red flag for me, so I asked him if I should erase. I thought this was just removing the phone from the find my iphone network and might not erase my data. He responded by telling me to just click erase the phone, so I did. I hold Apple responsible for this loss of data, however, when I informed them later what happened, they were not able to offer anything for my losses.Again, I run my business from my i-phone, and neither Apple nor T-mobile would offer me an immediate replacement, so I paid over $450 for a replacement iphone SE 2nd generation.This is terrible customer service on both T-mobile and Apple's side to not offer an immediate replacement for a defective phone. One of these parties needs to be held responsible. Additionally, Apple representatives need training to always ask and inform the customer when data is being deleted.Date of experience:November 22, 2020",31,Steve Roys,1,United States,2020-11-22 00:00:00.000000,warranty black light able obvious defective physical electrical fine next able new replacement senior red click responsible able immediate terrible immediate defective responsible inform,Positive

"Refurbished iPhone PurchaseIf you want to buy something from the online refurbished store, beware.I recently purchased a refurbished iPhone thru the online store via PayPal. The same day I purchased was notified that item shipped and was on its way. When the box arrived, there was a clear plastic InCase cover for a 13"" MacBook Air inside. No phone. I chatted online with a service specialist and was told the only option I had was to return the product to Apple. Once it was returned and in their system, it would take up to 5 business days to get my money refunded to my PayPal account.I didn't want a refund. I wanted what I bought from them and they told me they sent me. I just wanted them to send me another phone like the one I purchased and they can keep the money.The next day I looked on the refurbished store website and they still had phones like I purchased for sale. I called and talked to another specialist via phone. They apologized profusely, admitted the problem was theirs, but absolutely under no circumstances send me a different phone, unless I did a repurchase on a new order, investing even more of my money with them, with no assurance that the same thing or something even MORE bizarre would not happen again.I would expect something like this from a fly-by-night operation out of Podunk. Apple is supposed to be this tech-savvy cool company. Have purchased other items from the refurbished store before with no problems.Still waiting for my money. 8 days now.

"Broken product with poor customer serviceBackground:I purchased a pair of limited edition Studio3 Beats in porcelain rose from Cribbs Causeway Apple store Feb 2018.Unfortunately a couple of weeks ago the folding mechanism broke.I spoke to one of their advisors who advised that I was outside of my warranty period, but for £200 I would receive another pair of beats in the same colour porcelain rose.What has happened so far:I was sent a replacement pair of studio 3 beats in white.This was a shock to me, as I did not and would not buy a pair in white, or a pair that was not limited edition.At no point did any of the advisors suggest that this might be the outcome from this warranty exchange.I called the customer services to understand what was going on, and I was told a number of different stories.- Yes they are in stock in Porcelain Rose and we can replace them- No they are not in stock, but we will see what we can do to replace them.- Yes you can have the white ones collected and get a refund- No you have to keep the white ones, and we cant give you a refund- We could swap the white ones for black ones- When you return yours there was no guarantee that you would get porcelain rose- When you return your beats you only get the option of white or black and it is pot luckAs you can see the messaging of what options there are has been really confusing.I have been on the phone to many different agents for around 3+hrs over the last 24 hrs discussing all of these options.Where I am now:Apple are refusing to refund, or provide any alternatives, and so I am left with a pair of headphones I did not order without any packaging to enable me sell on.I am so disappointed with this service.

"Exploding iPhone BatteryLast night while my mom was using her phone, it overheated and the battery exploded, splitting the phone and exposing the interior. My mom was very upset when this happen as it was a clear safety hazard and it was something we had never experienced from Apple products. We googled whether this is safe, and the results stated that this is not safe, due to the chemicals in the battery being toxic and flammable. Which is ironic, as the report Apple gave us stated they had to replace the display, due to chemical damage from the battery leaking onto the display. I wouldn't want to know what could happen.We took the phone in today to let Apple know that this happened and that we were upset. They said we had to pay for a new battery. Which my mom reluctantly accepted, as all her photos and data were in the phone and she didn't want to loose them.When we picked up the phone and asked for a report on why the battery exploded and whether this was safe, as well as why we had to pay for the replacement, the employee was unsure. Fair as this didn't appear to be a common occurrence or anything the employee had experienced. My mom asked to speak to the manager, as she may have more insight and and could hear our concerns. She was very rude and disrespectful, in regard to my mom being upset and concerned about her safety. When my mom stated that she did not feel safe with having a phone that could explode and asked whether she should turn off the phone before she goes to bed, the manager replied ""sure, do whatever makes you feel safe"", as if an exploded phone was not shocking. When my mom asked why we had to pay for the replacement when this was an issue that was out of our hands, the manager replied, ""It's just like the warranty on a car. If you don't have warranty then you have to pay."". Additionally, while my mom was visibly upset and had begun to talk over the manager, the manager rudely replied, ""It's my turn to talk"".A few points. This phone is a safety hazard. The battery was leaking. This is not your regular warranty situation as it is not regular wear and tear related. My mom didn't crack her screen and was looking for quick fix. We're not adding to the millions of reduced battery life complaints (however that was present). And lastly, this is not something which we as customers made happen due to our negligence. This is an appliance, provided by Apple, which is faulty and is a safety hazard.

"APPLE is the WORST!!!Hey, bought a $2K+ laptop from Apple in May.  FedEx never delivered it.  Reported it to Apple for investigation.  Was supposed to take 5 days.  Took 10 days which was blamed on pandemic and holiday.  Then Apple billed me for a undelivered laptop!  Had to endure drama to get that sorted out.  Was offered a ""Good Will Gesture"" accessory for all my troubles and delays.  Contacted Apple twice about the accessory that to this day never came.  Contacted Apple again about it and they said that I was not eligible for ""Good Will Gesture.""  As if it was initiated by us!  ""F"" Apple!  They cannot be trusted.  They take advantage of female customers by using bullying tactics to get out of following through on their initiated promises.  They are shameful, disgraceful; they suck!!  We all should boycott Apple, until someone learns how to treat the very customers that have mistaken contributed to their position in the market.

"Disgusting Service!Unfortunately the general experience with Apple has been absolutely terrible and I surely will not be ordering a product directly from the online store. If i could select a minus option i would surely do so. For such a huge organisation who are very quick to take so much money for their products the customer journey is rubbish.I recently purchased the iphone 12 mini and later decided i want to return it. The return or cancel option is non-existent via the app store which i was continuously referred to. This therefore resulted in me having to call only to be put on hold for a long time and then be automatically cut off.After nearly a week of trying, i managed to get through only to be passed from one department to another with the end result being automatically disconnected.All i wanted was a simple return label or for a return process to be started which seems to be a new experience for Apple.

"Fork out £129 for a new batteryLast week I had to bring my Macbook Air in for repair, as the battery started playing up. I was able to make an appointment with a Genius bar over the phone (lady on the phone was helpful, hence the 1st star). When I got to the Apple store in London it was chaotic. It looked like there were 3 different queues going on, clearly people all desperate to get their devices fixed before the second lockdown. Not surprisingly, I queued up for a good 30 minutes. When I finally got in, the 'Genius' told me the battery had failed ''cause I leave it plugged in when it's not being used''. That was the only advice I got. I said I hardly do, but according to him that was it. The Macbook is just over 2 years old, with a cycle count at 46...? And the battery fails and it's my fault..?I was trying to ask about consumer law as well but apparently batteries never fall under that.. So I had to fork out £129 to replace the battery. The only good thing was that they had it replaced within a few hours, hence the second star. Other than that, the 'Genius' guy offered hardly any advice, I felt like I wasn't really listened to and having been out of a job for nearly 6 months I really could have done with a bit more help, especially bearing in mind they make MILLIONS.

"Poor Customer Service & Poor Memory on DevicesUpdate: I was having issues with my MacBook Pro updating. I finally got it updated, but Apple support was no help at all. I’ve also been having other issues. Apple has an issue right now where all of my devices keep having memory usage being filled in what they call the “Other” category. It’s to the point that I can’t update my devices because the “Other” category is using up almost all of the memory on my devices. Even if I delete all apps, photos, files, etc. On my devices there is still not enough storage. I’ve chatted with Apple support a number of times and the ONLY way to fix they can give me is to do a full restart wiping ALL memory. Which is VERY frustrating and time consuming. I just have to keep using my Apple devices watching the “Other” category slowly taking up more and more memory until I need to do another restart wiping all of the memory from my devices and then set up the device again starting the whole process over. Apple has NO fix for this and the feeling I get is that this is planned obsolescence by Apple so customers will see their devices with no memory and many customers will find it easier to just buy the latest devices rather than spend time wiping the memory and restarting the device from scratch. I’m sure this is great for more business in the short term to get people buying new devices, but I no longer recommend Apple to others like I used to. I’m on the search for better devices.Original Review: Apple used to have good customer service. I’m not sure what happened, but now it takes forever to schedule an appointment at an Apple store. Then you still need to wait for help even with an appointment. Then the “Geniuses” at the Apple store seem to be mildly trained employees that take forever to figure out what the issue is. Today (11/12/20) my Mac won’t update, and Apple removed the chat option from customer service on their website, so if I want to get help, then they make you call them and wait on hold until someone is available to pick up the call. This is SO disappointing. They don’t even have an option to leave your phone number to call you when they’re ready, so you don’t need to wait on your phone for hours.Date of experience:November 13, 2020",1,Lee Cheney,2,United States,2020-12-04 00:00:00.000000,poor poor call update enough fix full category restart whole obsolescence many easier spend sure great short new good sure schedule appointment trained forever update call available ready,Positive

"Don't trust Apple and don’t bother with expensive apple careI am almost heartbroken considering how loyal of an Apple customer I have been for decades. I am a designer and apple is used in every job and every home application I have ever had. I now have a family with two young children and I have been having a lot of issues with the parental controls and family sharing. These issues are costly and dangerous as the settings for location content and billing are all affected by the technical problems. We paid arms and legs for Apple care support and every person in my family owns multiple Apple devices. However the support has been completely ineffective. We’ve already been escalated to senior advisers and I’ve spoken to multiple senior advisers and they all assured me that they are going to help me and then either drop off the face of the earth or completely ineffectively try to address my problem with ridiculous and basic solutions. Finally they have escalated the problem to engineering however the engineers ask for one task or one setting to be changed per week or month essentially getting us nowhere. Meanwhile my children’s privacy and use of their devices, during a pandemic when we are dependent on these - is compromised. We have not been able to speak to engineering directly it’s always through messenger which takes a lot of time and if you don’t happen to be available right when they call you’re essentially dropped. I have a full time job and 2 children to care for.The amount of time that I have spent trying to speak with and deal with this issue with multiple advisers is unacceptable. It has been months and my issue has not been resolved or even addressed in a complete manner. This is really the worst technical support experience I’ve ever had with any company and I expect more from Apple. Products and support service are so expensive. Then to have problems that affect your family safety and your accounts and not even be able to actually address these issues with tech-support and not have any compensation or any additional support or escalation is ridiculous.

"I loved AppleI loved Apple. They were focused on the creative professional. Life was good until there was a management change. Now the company makes it difficult for creative professionals to even get access to their own documents. Note how impossible an act it is to put your own video content onto your iPhone. Additionally, Apple wants everyones intellectual property on their servers. Apple has forgotten that they have no right to IP. In fact most companies will not allow their secure information to go onto any cloud let alone the fallible servers at Apple. (No, Apple is not perfect and apple has no business even glancing at medical or engineering files). The bottom line, Apple does not serve professionals. It serves consumers.

I am no longer an apple fan, the worst customer service I think I’ve ever experienced!Date of experience:November 10, 2020",1,Consumer,1,United Kingdom,2020-11-10 00:00:00.000000,productive frozen loop old frozen technical technical uninterested empathy difficult drag frozen full fur appointment belief explanation experienced,Positive
"I am very disappointed to discover that…I am very disappointed to discover that greed has overwhelmed apple to the point where they have stooped so low as to tell the tech support not to spend more than 15 min with someone who has an older mac and that they should buy a new one or they are on their own. I was unable to get on the net because I needed to upgrade the OS. They told me to go and get a disk at the store and after waiting a week for an appointment I was told by the store that I would have to get it from tech support. After going back and forth for weeks to get this resolved, even going as far as sending an email to the CEO which was never answered, and being treated with contempt by supervisors, also being told that there is nothing that could be done and that I need to buy a new computer I have decided to switch to Microsoft. If I have to buy new it will NEVER be another apple product. The experience has made me understand why apple only has 8% market share.Date of experience:November 10, 2020",2,gsemoes,1,United States,2020-11-10 00:00:00.000000,disappointed low new unable net get tech forth new new understand,Negative
"My loyalty is no longer!I have been an apple fan for a long time but after the latest purchase of an iPhone 11 I'm not so faithful. The new phone has a cable but no plug to charge the phone with. I rang Apple and they told me I have to buy one! So I paid £599 for a new phone and cannot charge it. I don't have any plugs that fit the cable! Well done Apple!Date of experience:November 10, 2020",4,The Verb,1,United Kingdom,2020-11-10 00:00:00.000000,long faithful new new,Positive
